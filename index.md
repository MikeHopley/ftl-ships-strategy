# Context

I made these notes during my second and third win-streaks, mostly to help me remember some less obvious ideas. I've tidied them up and added to them, so they might help other people too. I also mention [Balance Mod](http://www.it-is-law.com/ftl-balance/index.php?title=Main_Page) differences.

This is about winning consistently on Hard, which means playing as "safely" as possible and getting through the dangerous early game in good shape. To be "safe", you need two things ASAP:

* Two shields
* Offence that works well against two-shield enemies

"Offence" at this stage usually means a weapon, but it could be hacking, mind control, teleporter, or a combat drone. Prefer 1- or 2-power weapons that you can get online quickly.

Hacking is especially strong. When I say "look for a weapon", that's really  shorthand for "look for a weapon, or hacking, or other offence". But ideally I like to start with a good weapon, then add hacking a bit later.


# General strategy

For most ships and most runs:

* Spend your first 20 scrap on shields-3
* Spend your next 30 scrap on shields-4
* Then save up for a weapon, or other offence

Shields-3 provides a damage buffer, so your shield will not go down from (say) a Leto. Bad luck if it's an Artemis instead, but at least your shield comes back sooner. Most of the time, you can get away without this; but it only takes one nasty fight where you lose 20 hull to make you appreciate the value of shields-3.

Don't wait on power before buying shields-4. Having two shields makes you vastly safer in sectors 1 and 2: many enemies will be unable to hurt you at all. Power can come much later; save for a weapon first.

This strategy has a downside: it may prevent you from buying something useful in a sector 1 store, such as a great weapon. Sector 2 could have an awful layout that prevents you from finding any stores; or you might visit two stores and find only crew and augments. This is unlikely but possible.

For that reason, there can be some benefit in delaying your shield upgrades slightly. There are two possibilities:

* Get shields-3 immediately, but delay shields-4
* Delay both

You can also choose how long you delay them. You could delay just a few jumps, because you are circling around a store in the middle of the sector. Or you could be very greedy, and delay them until you reach a store at the end of sector 1 or even the beginning of sector 2.

In my view, it's usually not worth delaying shields more than a few jumps, and even then only in favourable circumstances. In many cases it would be best not to delay shields at all.

The balance of risk varies by the ship. Some ships have safer starts. Some ships are more desperate for additional offence. Some ships have more stuff to sell at a store. As an overview, here's what I currently think:

* 15 ships should immediately buy shields-3 then shields-4, no matter what
* 7 ships should **consider** delaying shield upgrades
* 1 ship should **definitely** delay shield upgrades (Zoltan A)
* 5 ships work differently (Stealth Cruisers, Zoltan B, Mantis B)

## Other strategies

Engines-2 and engines-3 are useful and cheap. Fit them in when you can, but do not allow engine upgrades to stop you upgrading shields or buying an important weapon. At 15 scrap, engines-3 competes with shields-3, and I think shields-3 is almost strictly better.

Note that shields-4 is **much** better than early engine upgrades, because it also lets you farm crew skill against enemies that cannot hurt you. 10% free evade works out around 90 scrap value!

Piloting-2 can be tempting when you're visiting lots of nebula beacons without a clone bay, for a [chance of a free weapon](http://ftl.wikia.com/wiki/Plasma_Storm_Incapacitated_Ships). But this is very luck-dependent. That 20 scrap is better spent on shields-3.

Never waste early-game scrap on luxury purchases like medbay-2, doors-2, or Scrap Recovery Arm.

## Balance Mod

Burst Laser 2 costs 90 scrap, hacking 120. Much of your starting equipment sells for less, especially augments. Flak 1 costs 75 and is much less common.

The important scrap thresholds are 120, 90, 75, and 55. I'm sad about visiting stores with less than 75 scrap, but 55 is enough for weapons like Burst Laser 1, Heavy Laser, Small Bomb, and many others.


# Some tips are micro-optimisations

In this guide, I've included small optimisations that are unlikely to make a difference in most cases. I mainly include them for my own benefit. These advanced tactics often come with a price: they can be tedious to perform, and getting them wrong might make things worse.

For example, on some ships I think it's optimal to run your pilot to doors during the FTL jump, for boarding defence...but it's **really** easy to forget you did this! Or on the Zoltan B, there is a fiddly tactic to optimise your weapon usage against certain enemies...but messing it up will depower your weapons!

I've included these tactics because I *think* they are optimal. You might decide some tactics are incorrect, or too error-prone, or just too tedious to bother with. Feel free to pick and choose!


# The ships

## Kestrel A

The starting weapons can handle two-shield enemies, so get shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon.

Conserve missiles, but do use the Artemis against threatening weapons. Keep the Artemis unless you need the slot or absolutely need the scrap. If you find no weapons but do get crew, consider buying a teleporter: the Artemis provides good boarding support.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. With no special systems or crew, distress beacons are less good than usual&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;possibly still better than a "standard" beacon, but worse than a guaranteed fight (if you have map data).

Consider running your pilot to doors during the FTL jump. Just remember to send them back!

### Balance Mod

The Artemis lets you sneak hacking past defence drones. Bear this in mind for the flagship.


## Kestrel B

The starting weapons can handle two-shield enemies, so get shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon. Your Zoltan can power shields-3 against ion.

Ideally you want fast weapons to complement your remaining Basic Lasers. If you find only slow weapons, consider hacking or mind control instead, as this keeps your volley fast for longer. You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little early anyway.

Move the shield-room Mantis to doors initially. You probably want the Zoltan on engines. Remember you can use them to "de-ionise" shields. Cooldown systems like hacking and mind control appear rather far away from the main systems, so power-stealing is awkward.

Distress beacons are less good than usual&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;possibly still better than a "standard" beacon, but worse than a guaranteed fight (if you have map data).


## Kestrel C

Treat it as a weaker Lanius A (no hacking) or Kestrel A (weaker weapons). Shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon. Dual Lasers are fantastic on a 4-slot ship; almost always keep them. The Ion Stunner can help you get crew kills: destroy O2, then stun the crew repairing it.

Typcially you'll wait a moment for the Ion Stunner to (nearly) reach shields, then fire the Dual Lasers at weapons. But against some enemy weapons, it's better to fire immediately. If all shots hit, the Dual Lasers will take down one weapon, and the ion will disable the second (even a two-power weapon).

Put the Lanius on piloting, to protect it from boarders and help with nearby venting. Pre-vent nearby rooms, then allow them to refill slightly: refilling makes it easier for other crew to distract your Lanius if they get mind-controlled. Run your Lanius pilot to doors during the FTL jump; just remember to send them back!

With a Lanius and clone bay, venting below 50% oxygen is reasonably safe. Consider doing this in the early game, to increase the chance that enemies target O2 instead of something that matters.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual.

### Balance Mod

The ship has been remade to make it distinctive. It's probably slightly weaker, but much more interesting. Buffed FTL Recharge Booster + engines-4 let you run **fast**. Piloting-2 also helps. You can reliably dive in sector 1, or even double-dive; ASBs will rarely hit before you can escape, and the Breach Bomb helps take the sting out of Rebel Elite weapons.

Weapons are weak, but effective for crew kills. Destroying O2 and scoring breaches drains oxygen fast, and the Breach Bomb deals 30 crew damage. Breaches attract a second crew once repaired, giving a chance to hurt two crew with one laser or bomb. When the enemy has spare hull, try to get breaches from the Hull Laser instead (saving bombs). On the other hand, it's worth spending bombs on scary enemy weapons. Sometimes you can use the Breach Bomb for early skill-farming against automated ships (permanently disabling a weapon).

Fast running means you can delay shields-3, and maybe even shields-4, in the hope of finding a good weapon. But remember shields-4 also helps you fish for more crew kills! Mind control is particularly good early on, as it complements your crew-killing play.

Even though you have a Slug now, it's still probably better to leave the Lanius in piloting.

Avoid selling the Recharge Booster! It's a good economic augment that also makes you safer. At 35 scrap it's often worth buying; you can think of it as "budget Long-Ranged Scanners".

The Breach Bomb can disable defence drones, letting you sneak hacking past them. Bear this in mind for the flagship. Flagship drone slots have been rearranged so that the defence drone goes down first.


## Engi A

Shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon.

Early on, micromanage the drone to break a shield for your ion, which can then rapidly take down weapons. Against harmless ships, try ionising O2 for a crew kill (and this is a good reason for rushing shields-4).

Late-game the Ion Blast 2 needs help from another ion weapon to reliably take down shields. This leaves only one slot for a hull-damaging weapon. Some combinations work, but don't be afraid to ditch the ion in exchange for reliable damage-dealers.

Med-bot Dispersal is fine to keep or sell (definitely sell it for anything important). Take particular note of the [unknown disease event](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Unknown_Disease_on_Mining_Colony), which gives a high scrap reward and a weapon, provided you have both med-bots and medbay-2. This event occurs in Civilian, Pirate, Mantis, Rock, and Uncharted Nebula sectors (at a distress beacon).

Medbay-2 is still not worth buying early, but consider it once you are stable&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;providing you kept the augment and are visiting a distress beacon in one of those sectors, especially later in the game.

Start your engines crew on doors. Just remember to send them back!


## Engi B

You urgently need extra offence, since you **cannot** harm ships with two shields. On the other hand, your bad offence makes you vulnerable. A good compromise might be to rush shields-3, but consider delaying shields-4.

If your weapons take one damage, you can still attack. Fire the ion then switch to the laser (you can wait to see if the ion hits).

Remember to use your Engi for manning and repairs; you only have 10% dodge anyway. Walk them towards weapons during the FTL jump. Consider venting below 50% oxygen to reduce the chance of enemies targeting weapons. Your repair drones make this quite safe, but the layout is a little awkward. Rather than venting important rooms (like shields, weapons, or medbay), turn off O2 to get the oxygen a little lower.

Try crew kills when safe. Use the Heavy Laser as a shield-breaker, so you can ion O2. This is one reason not to delay shields-4 too long.

Drone Reactor Booster has little effect and can be sold immediately. Consider buying crew; and until you get more crew, try to keep the AP drone and one repair drone. AP drone sells for 17, repair drones for 15 each, and DRB for 25. Heavy Ion sells for 22. This gives a total of **94 scrap** in sellable items (excluding Heavy Laser), so it's also reasonable to visit a store on your first jump.

Note that enemy boarders will stay in an airless room, provided they are already fighting your "crew". Try to time your venting so that the AP drone arrives shortly before the air leaves.

Heal your AP drone between fights, even though it's tedious. [Park repair drones](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/8mxqw5/depower_a_repair_drone_to_park_it_in_a_system/) for quicker repairs and to prevent boarders trashing them. Note that having even one extra crew helps you [control repair drones](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/7wvjed/controlling_system_repair_drones/).

&hellip;and I lied. It is [technically possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/6eoqw6/impossible_to_get_through_2_bubbles_with_the/) to kill two-shield enemies with your starting weapons, if you're utterly desperate.


### Balance Mod

You start with piloting-3, so nebulae have a [chance of a free weapon or crew](http://ftl.wikia.com/wiki/Plasma_Storm_Incapacitated_Ships). Drone Reactor Booster is somewhat useful early on and provides solid comedy value.

Selling all the drone stuff nets you 57 scrap, or 79 if you also sell the Heavy Ion Stunner (repair drones sell for 10 each, AP drone for 12).

Because your system repair drones move faster, you are slightly safer, making it more reasonable to delay shield upgrades. It's still probably safest to rush shields-3. Heavy Ion Stunner can self-stack with a fully-trained gunner, so finding weapons is *slightly* less urgent. It also makes crew kills a bit easier (stun crew repairing the O2).


## Engi C

Shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon. Dual Lasers are great, but may eventually need to be replaced with more slot-efficient weapons.

This ship has a strong start, but must manage drone parts carefully. At each fight, consider whether to use your beam drone, hacking, both&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;or neither! Remember that preventing a damage cascade is more important than hoarding resources, and this is especially relevant while you only have 1 shield.

Try crew kills when safe: hack O2 then immediately destroy it. Hacking often lets you farm crew skill early, by de-synchronising enemy weapons. For example, Heavy Laser + Basic Laser is completely harmless once hacked.

Don't forget the weirdly-placed airlock on the drones room! With a Lanius and clone bay, venting below 50% oxygen is reasonably safe. Consider doing this in the early game, to increase the chance that enemies target O2 instead of something that matters.

Start your engines crew on sensors, and run your pilot to doors during the FTL jump. Just remember to send them back!

Hacking's cooldown resets when you jump.

### Balance Mod

Defence Scrambler sells for 20. Try to keep it, so you can hack ships with defence drones (notably flagship phase 2).


## Federation A

Shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon. Teleporter is a reasonable fallback plan, since you start with decent boarders.

Artillery is nice late-game if you have scrap to spare (particularly for the flagship), but too expensive to upgrade earlier.

Since artillery uses a system slot, you can only pick two more systems. [Defence drones work badly on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/Y92J2ml.jpg) (weapons and drones are vulnerable).

Your diverse crew makes distress beacons great. Put the Rock on piloting and the Mantis on weapons. Move the Engi to doors initially. Consider pre-venting the empty rooms on the right side, then letting them refill a bit.


## Federation B

Shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon. Leto is weak but worth keeping unless you need the slot for something else. Dual Lasers are fantastic on a 4-slot ship; almost always keep them.

[Defence drones are awful on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/TpuD5BE.jpg): shields and weapons are vulnerable. Avoid spending scrap on the artillery beam, unless everything else is set.

Put the Slug in piloting. Consider putting the Zoltan in weapons: they can "de-ionise" shields, and steal power from mind control or hacking, which are slotted nearby. On the other hand, cloaking slots next to engines. Consider starting the engines crew on doors; just remember to send them back!

The layout is a little awkward, but you can still vent shields or weapons in under 3 seconds by using **all** airlocks and turning off O2.

Distress beacons are less good than usual&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;possibly still better than a "standard" beacon, but worse than a guaranteed fight (if you have map data).

### Balance Mod

The Leto lets you sneak hacking past defence drones. Bear this in mind for the flagship.


## Federation C

Shields-3, shields-4, then look for weapons. Weapons-2 costs 40 scrap, so 1-power weapons are particularly helpful early on.

When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 2 hull).

Remember to use the airlocks on clone bay and shields! They are hard to see.

Mantis and Human are the strongest and safest boarding party (Zoltan bombing is more cute than effective). Keeping Zoltans at home also has tactical advantages: they can ion-proof your clone bay, ion-proof one shield layer entirely, or "de-ionise" shields even when you have multiple layers.

Emergency Respirators make automated ships much easier to board. Keep them until you need to sell them for something better, like a weapon.

You can only buy one system, so buy hacking. [Defence drones are bad on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/4kNq8jj.jpg) (weapons, cloaking, and drones are vulnerable).

As usual, the artillery is too expensive to upgrade, unless you are late in the game with plenty of scrap.

### Balance Mod

The Repair Burst makes boarding safer. Have it ready in case your clone bay goes down, or for any other urgent repairs. It only takes 5 seconds to charge.

It also means you can skip shields-3. Even delaying shields-4 may be reasonable, so you can be greedier looking for weapons in stores.

With the Repair Burst and a clone bay, venting below 50% oxygen is reasonably safe. Consider doing this in the early game, to increase the chance that enemies target O2 instead of something that matters. The layout is a little awkward for this though, so maybe pre-vent and let O2 refill slightly.

Flak artillery is slightly buffed, but still bad. Emergency Respirators sell for 12.


## Zoltan A

The Zoltan Shield provides strong defence in most fights, the Halberd never misses, and the Leto is a backup if your weapons get damaged. Therefore this ship has a very safe start. It's also important to find hacking or shield-breaking weapons before sector 3. **Delay shield upgrades** enough to visit any store with 80 scrap (including sector 1 stores). Shields-4 is the next priority.

You start with only engines-1. Engines-2 and engines-3 are cheap and work well with the Zoltan Shield, but shields-4 is still better. Fit in engine upgrades later, when you can.

Halberd trashes early enemies; start the beam in shields for maximum damage. Leto is weak, but works in a pinch; it's worth keeping unless you need the slot.

Your first extra crew member is worth one free power, replacing the pilot. Don't forget that two Zoltans can completely ion-proof one shield layer, and can also "de-ionise" shields.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. Distress beacons are less good than usual&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;possibly still better than a "standard" beacon, but worse than a guaranteed fight (if you have map data).

### Balance Mod

Hacking costs 120, so it's harder to pick up in sector 1. Nevertheless, visiting stores with at least 55 scrap is still useful, as this lets you buy almost any one- or two-power weapon. Burst Laser 2 is 90, Flak 1 is 75.

The Leto lets you sneak hacking past defence drones. Bear this in mind for the flagship.


## Zoltan B

Consider avoiding nebula beacons, as they often have Auto-assaults (with drones). If you meet [the mercenary](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mercenary) early in sector 1, it might be worth paying for map data to avoid asteroid fields.

The starting weapons are strong and *can* last for a long time. But even against 2-shield enemies, the ion cascade starts to get slow: a miss on the first volley means waiting over 20 seconds to deal any damage. Adding more ion works, or you can abandon the ion cascade entirely. A single Ion Blast still removes one shield layer, or takes one weapon offline.

Use your weapons optimally against enemies with one shield. You can fire both ions immediately at weapons (or drones), and the Pike Beam will still do full damage before the shield comes up. On the second volley, you can sneak at least one ion inside the shield: micromanage them so both fire from the third weapon slot initially (giving a longer travel time), then bring them forwards for the second volley (be careful though: with a Zoltan in the room, weapons depower as you move them!).

When enemies have one shield and cannot harm you, try ionising O2 for a crew kill. It's theoretically possible to use the Pike Beam [as an Anti-bio Beam](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/72lds2/every_beam_can_be_an_antibio_beam/), but the timing is painfully difficult.

Shields-2 costs a whopping 100 scrap. Before then, your Zoltan Shield will serve well in most encounters, but you are vulnerable against asteroid fields, drones, and even suns. Therefore your first 100 scrap should typically be spent on shields. It's also reasonable to buy a weapon first, but only if it's a great weapon (like a Flak 1 or Heavy Laser) or a useful cheap weapon (like another Ion Blast).

Do not buy engine upgrades before shields, even though they're so much cheaper: you don't even need evasion for most fights, and it won't help you much in the really dangerous fights. Getting that shield up even one jump earlier could be crucial.

With the Zoltan Shield and shields-2, you are reasonably safe. Consider delaying shields-3 and maybe shields-4, in the hope of finding a good weapon.

This ship is somewhat vulnerable to boarding. Start the engines Zoltan on doors (due to event boarding). Additional crew help, and the first gives one free power by replacing the pilot. If doors get boarded, you can vent them out and then reoccupy it. Consider pre-venting the three empty rooms to the right of doors (and then letting oxygen refill a bit).

Don't forget that two Zoltans can completely ion-proof one shield layer, and can also "de-ionise" shields. Here's a surprising fact about pulsars: even while you only have shields-1, a single Zoltan in the shields room will guarantee that the pulse hits the shield system (but probably it's better to just send all three Zoltans into the weapons).

Distress beacons are less good than usual&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;possibly still better than a "standard" beacon, but worse than a guaranteed fight (if you have map data).

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones work badly on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/hUidgrH.jpg) (weapons and drones are vulnerable).

### Balance Mod

Auto-assaults (which have drones) no longer appear in sector 1, so jumping to nebula beacons is safer.


## Zoltan C

Zoltan Shield provides strong defence in most fights, so consider delaying shields-3 or even shields-4, in the hope of finding a good weapon. Power constraints also make shields-4 less immediately useful (although still very good).

Autofiring the ion on shields is not always the best tactic. Consider sending some ion into enemy weapons; this kills ships more slowly but can be safer. Micro the drone so it doesn't waste time firing when their shield is up. Against enemies with two shields, fully charge the Charge Ion for the first volley to help it "stick" (and if you only hit one shot, start again).

Delay using the backup battery as long as possible&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;usually after your Zoltan Shield goes down. Position the beam drone so it will fire the instant shields go down, then divert its power to engines. You do not need the battery for this! When the beam drone has started firing, cutting power will not interrupt its beam; you can micro that power to engines as a shot comes in.

With that in mind, consider your crew positions carefully, and move them around as needed. You can start two Zoltans in weapons, with the other two in engines and piloting. This is simple and flexible. When fights drag on and your battery is about to run out, consider moving the pilot. Your first extra crew member gives one free power (replacing the pilot).

For better defence in boarding events, you can start a Zoltan in doors (with the others in weapons, piloting, engines). This complicates optimal power micro and has little benefit in sector 1, since you are very unlikely to find a boarding event with a ship fight ([Encrypted Federation Signal](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Encrypted_Federation_Signal), and then only 20% of the time).

The clone bay is vulnerable to event boarding; pre-vent it, then let oxygen refill to 90%. This lets you vent the clone bay in 4 seconds using 4 airlocks. If you forget to do this, you can use all 6 airlocks (venting through weapons too). In both cases, you also need to turn off O2.

Charge Ion is the best ion weapon in the game. Adding another 2-power ion weapon will take down shields reliably for the whole game (even a 1-power ion will do, especially mid-game). Hacking somewhat overlaps with the ion cascade, but is still very strong. For example, hack shields and ionise weapons.

Early reactor upgrades are expensive. In the early game, avoid buying more than you absolutely need. You can get by with much less than you might think, for quite some time.

Backup battery's cooldown resets when you jump.



## Mantis A

Shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon. Don't forget weapons-2 is 40 scrap; buying this lets you use the Small Bomb and Basic Laser together. Mantis Pheromones is somewhat useful, but also fine to sell. Small Bomb is a great boarding support weapon, and can also disable enemy weapons. Use it liberally in sector 1 to reduce risk.

When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 2 hull). Boarding with 3 crew can often disable clone/medbays without spending missiles.

Start two Mantis in the teleporter. I like the third Mantis on piloting, as that's closer to the teleporter and makes the Engi more mobile. Start your fourth crew on weapons, then run to engines as needed.

Consider upgrading teleporter somewhat early, as this lets you board automated ships.

Weapons and shields are awkward to vent. Consider pre-venting them, then letting oxygen refill a bit.

### Balance Mod

The Small Bomb can disable defence drones, letting you sneak hacking past them. Bear this in mind for the flagship. Flagship drone slots have been rearranged so that the defence drone goes down first.

## Mantis B

Occasionally you can get wrecked in the early game, due to terrible firefighting and repairs. Although getting a weapon lets you fight Zoltan ships, the absolute priority is additional crew. Buying crew improves offence and (critically) repairs.

Rushing engines-2 and engines-3 (or piloting-2) is cheap and helps you run from dangerous fights (e.g. solar flare + enemy with nasty weapons). However, it could stop you buying crew. So on balance, my preferred strategy is:

* Engines-2 immediately
* Save scrap for buying crew (ideally an Engi)

If you don't find crew, consider buying a weapon instead. One-power weapons are particularly good, because you can use them immediately. A Small Bomb lets you disable enemy weapons (or medbays). An Ion Blast is cheap and lets you attack Zoltan ships.

Precise venting helps against solar flares or fire-lighting weapons. Just before the fire starts, have no oxygen in the bottom-left corner, and switch off O2; but also close the doors. [Repairing O2 is possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47ENy6-CAM&t=1m22s) even in a fully-vented ship, providing you have medbay-2: you'll need to run relays, and the timing is very tight.

Have the pilot Mantis move to the teleporter during the FTL jump, and start the other Mantis in sensors. This delays boarding by under 2 seconds, and in some trickier situations sensor information can stop you sending crew on a suicide mission. When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 2 hull).

Your defences are strong, but not quite as strong as they appear. The defence drone is [unreliable at protecting shields and drones](https://i.imgur.com/qSlV6gW.jpg).

Don't hesitate to spend drone parts when fights look dangerous. Your boarding drone is not just for automated ships. A rapid crew-kill can be your best defence.

Mantis Pheromones is nice to have while you're still boarding with two crew, but when you fill up the teleporter it becomes less relevant. Fine to keep or sell.

### Balance Mod

Piloting-2 is 25 scrap instead of 20, so I'd probably take engines-3 first.


## Mantis C

Shields-3, shields-4, then look for weapons. If you're still low on crew in the mid-game, buy some.

Start the Mantis in the teleporter. Walk the Engi pilot to sensors during the FTL jump (force them to go the bottom route), and the Lanius from weapons to the teleporter (so the teleporter stays oxygenated). This gives you sensor information, and lets you board as fast as possible with either two or three crew (usually just two, Lanius and Mantis). When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 2 hull).

The Lanius cannot use the medical airlock, so try to limit damage to them or get them killed off just before the fight ends. Remember that the Engi can board too. Boarding with 3 crew can often disable clone/medbays without spending missiles.

Stun Bomb and Lockdown Bomb are both reasonable boarding support weapons, but overlap in their function. There's little need to keep both, and the Stun Bomb is generally more useful; with good timing, you can stun enemy crew and avoid stunning your own, while also disabling a weapon or drone.

Mantis Pheromones is nice to have while you're still (mostly) boarding with two crew, but less relevant once your teleporter is full. Fine to keep or sell.

[Defence drones are awful on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/QALokZf.jpg), as shields and weapons are vulnerable.

With a Lanius and clone bay, venting below 50% oxygen is reasonably safe. Consider doing this in the early game, to increase the chance that enemies target O2 instead of something that matters.

### Balance Mod

The Stun Bomb can disable defence drones, letting you sneak hacking past them. But for the flagship phase 2, it's faster to board their drones system (the crew should already be dead).

Stun Bomb sells for 17, Lockdown Bomb for 12.


## Slug A

Shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon. Rushing shields gives you more opportunities for safe crew kills. Slug Repair Gel is fine to keep or sell (sells for 20 in Balance Mod).

Start fights with Dual Lasers and Breach Bomb powered, then switch to Anti-bio Beam when enemies are not a threat. Use the bomb against threatening weapons. The Breach Bomb can be an effective crew-killing weapon too (target O2); remember that breaches attract a second crew once repaired, giving a chance to double the damage from a laser or bomb. Sometimes you can use the Breach Bomb for early skill-farming against automated ships (permanently disabling a weapon).

Dual Lasers are fantastic on a 4-slot ship; almost always keep them. Anti-bio Beam is good for crew-kills early on, but falls off later; don't be afraid to sell it in exchange for something more straightforward. Breach Bomb remains useful the whole game, but you may find something more potent instead.

Start your second Slug on weapons, then move to engines as needed. Venting the front of the ship is awkward, so consider pre-venting and letting oxygen refill a bit.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones work well on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/IQpdpCr.jpg), as all rooms are outside the blind spot.

Distress beacons are less good than usual&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;possibly still better than a "standard" beacon, but worse than a guaranteed fight (if you have map data).

### Balance Mod

The Breach Bomb can disable defence drones, letting you sneak hacking past them. Bear this in mind for the flagship. Flagship drone slots have been rearranged so that the defence drone goes down first.


## Slug B

Shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon. You don't need clone/medbay as urgently as you might think (prefer clone bay).

Even without Reconstructive Teleport, you *can* skip clone/medbay entirely. This gives an extra system slot. However, it also means you'll have a harder time finding the systems you actually want (hacking!), because clone/medbay will always take up a slot in the store. On balance, I feel it's better to pick up a medical system.

Consider teleporter-2, so you can more safely board automated ships. Without it, you can still board if you destroy piloting with your Artemis first (guaranteeing the Healing Burst will hit).

Healing Burst and Slug Repair Gel are fine to keep or sell. Keep the Artemis, unless you need the slot for something more important or desperately need the scrap.

Start fights with one Slug in the teleporter, one in weapons, and the pilot walking towards the teleporter during the FTL jump. This gives the most flexibility: you have the option of boarding immediately, and also charging your Artemis as fast as possible.

Precise boarding technique helps your bombs/missiles hit. Use the [Safety Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0j4rFfmFDc) to pull the pilot away. When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 2 hull).

You can fight in the weapons room and hit it with a missile, dodging your crew out just in time. But it's difficult to time consistently, so never do this when your crew are low on health (the Artemis does 30 crew damage).

[Defence drones work badly on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/vOgB7mg.jpg), as weapons and clone/medbay are vulnerable.

### Balance Mod

Slug Repair Gel sells for 20, Healing Burst for 12. Healing Burst charges quicker. Reconstructive Teleport costs 45.

The Artemis lets you sneak hacking past defence drones. Bear this in mind for the flagship.


## Slug C

Shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon. Slug Repair Gel is fine to keep or sell (sells for 20 in Balance Mod).

Rushing shields gives you more opportunities for safe crew kills. Mind control can often get the job done by itself (with a few lasers to finish them off). Otherwise hack oxygen.

Chain Laser is slow, but you can still get the first shot by hacking enemy weapons. Hack liberally to reduce damage and risk, especially while you only have 1 shield. Consider buying a weapons buffer, but not if it might prevent you buying a weapon.

Early-game tactics are slightly different depending on enemy crew count. Against two crew, mind control the pilot when you fire the Chain Laser. But against three crew, immediately mind control the weapons crew instead: this guarantees one point of system damage at 12.5 seconds.

When completely safe and with a guaranteed crew-kill, damage the hull for surrender offers (as low as 2 hull). The safest way to do this is mind-controlling the pilot (on ships with level 1 piloting). Hacking often lets you farm crew skill early, by de-synchronising enemy weapons. For example, Heavy Laser + Basic Laser is completely harmless once hacked.

[Defence drones work well on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/bhrfCeE.jpg), as all rooms are outside the blind spot.

Hacking and mind control reset their cooldowns when you jump.


## Rock A

You urgently need non-missile offence. Ideally get good weapons, but you really need *two* weapons to make a reasonable loadout for sector 3, and that can be tricky without some luck. Nevertheless, a single non-missile weapon can at least reduce your missile usage, so consider damage-dealers like a Heavy Laser. Even an Ion Blast is good, as it's cheap and helps against Zoltan Shields.

Seriously consider buying a teleporter. This fixes your missile dependency and gives you a reliable way to win fights for a long time, as the Artemis is a great boarding support weapon. Unfortunately that means boarding with painfully slow Rocks and leaving just a pilot at home. At least the teleporter slots right next to the medbay. When you get more crew (especially Mantis and Engi), it will be much more comfortable.

The Artemis has a 2-point weapons buffer, so consider delaying shield upgrades in the hope of hitting a good store.

Use missiles as efficiently as possible, but do use them against threatening weapons. When enemy hull is not a multiple of 4, destroy piloting with the Artemis to guarantee the Hull Missile will hit. Accept missile-heavy surrenders. Sometimes it might not be worth fighting a Zoltan ship. As a last resort, buy missiles: it's better than being unable to win fights.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones work well on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/Hrmzp9N.jpg), as all rooms are outside the blind spot.

### Balance Mod

Explosive Replicator means you can keep using missiles a bit longer, especially if you accept missile-heavy surrenders. Buying missiles is also much less crippling (they effectively cost 2.5 scrap, instead of 6). Remember to buy them before you get too low&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you don't start with many!

Alternative offence is still a priority, and possibly before upgrading shields. Rock Plating sells for 30, Hull Missile for 22, Explosive Replicator for 20. Teleporter costs 85.

Keeping the Artemis lets you sneak hacking past defence drones. Bear this in mind for the flagship.


## Rock B

Your offence is good initially, but terrible against two-shield enemies. You also have a weapons buffer for the Heavy Pierce. Consider delaying shield upgrades, in the hope of finding a good store.

Heavy Pierce is good early on, but power-hungry and does not play well with beam weapons. The Fire Bomb can get some early crew kills, but only use it when you are safe. Avoid selling the Fire Bomb unless it gets you something important, as it can help you kill the flagship crew.

By itself, the Fire Bomb is not that effective, except against Mantis. Enemies prioritise fighting fires, and can usually put them out efficiently. The bomb explosion does 30 crew damage, but that's a lot of missiles to kill crew directly. Soften them up with the Heavy Pierce first; either target crew directly, or maybe try for a breach in O2. Breaches attract a second crew once repaired, giving a chance to double your Fire Bomb damage. Beware enemies running away, however.

It's tempting to upgrade weapons early, so you can use them together; but this doesn't improve your offence enough. That scrap is better saved for buying a weapon, a system, or shields-4. Mind control or hacking makes the Fire Bomb much more effective. Also consider a teleporter for Rock fire-boarding shenanigans.

Doors are much too expensive to buy. Note you don't get airlocks, although hull breaches can be used. You *can* fire-bomb your own ship to help with boarding defence, but this is rarely useful. Mind control helps, especially against the flagship. Phase 3 boarders can be rough without doors/venting, so you have extra incentive to kill the crew in phase 1; you can do this by fire-bombing shields, together with mind control or hacking.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones work well on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/FUSYVNi.jpg), as all rooms are outside the blind spot.

### Balance Mod

Doors are much cheaper (30), but still not worth it unless you're trying to improve your odds of finding other systems later. Rock Plating sells for 30, Fire Bomb for 22, Teleporter costs 85.


## Rock C

You have a 2-point buffer for the Heavy Crystal. Consider delaying shield upgrades, in the hope of finding a good weapon.

Weapons are good early on, but a little awkward to upgrade. In particular, Heavy Crystal doesn’t play well with beams. Although inaccurate against small rooms, Swarm Missiles can fire before almost any enemy weapon. Use them to reduce damage and risk, especially early on.

Remember to use your Crystal tactically when defending against boarders! You have good boarding crew, so a teleporter is a good fallback plan if weapons are lacking.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones work well on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/xtqlP7k.jpg), as all rooms are outside the blind spot.

### Balance Mod

Both starting weapons can distract defence drones, allowing hacking to slip through. Rock Plating sells for 30, Teleporter costs 85.


## Stealth A

Plan your jumps carefully, to avoid being forced into asteroid fields. Suns and pulsars are also bad, since they have a higher chance of enemies with drones. Look for flexible routes, so you can skip these hazards without losing beacons. Consider avoiding nebulas too, as they often contain Auto-assaults (with drones).

Time your volley precisely. It's often best to wait a moment before firing the Dual Lasers, so that the Mini Beam damages engines to increase the chance of the second laser hitting. When possible, start firing the Dual Lasers before cloaking. The Mini Beam can hit four rooms on many ships.

Your weapons are strong initially, but slot-inefficient. You'll probably replace one of them eventually, and it's difficult to choose which. If you're hacking shields, maybe keep the Mini Beam; otherwise, maybe keep the Dual Lasers.

As on Stealth B, keeping oxygen below 50% decreases the chance of weapons/cloaking being hit. With fast weapons though (and a long walk to sensors), it's not worth using the weapons depower trick.

90% evade during cloak gives you good defences, but you can still get unlucky&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;especially against drones. Spending your first 25 scrap on a weapons buffer significantly improves survivability: those weapons are your strongest defence early on. After weapons-3, save up for shields and weapons. If you see a great weapon, buy it before shields. Also consider buying temporary weapons, such as an Ion Blast.

Cloaking-2 fills a similar role to weapons-3, as it often lets you fire an extra volley. I think weapons-3 is better, because (a) your weapons can still get hit through cloaking and (b) it will be useful when you get more weapons. Taking *both* weapons-3 and cloaking-2 makes you very safe in sectors 1 and 2, but I think that 30 scrap is better saved for offence and shields.

Once you have shields, upgrading them is not urgent (since you have cloak too). You can skip shields-3, which effectively does the same job as your weapons buffer. However, shields-4 is still a priority, and getting it early gives you more chance of training evade against the easier enemies in sector 2. Also remember you can use the Mini Beam [as an Anti-bio Beam](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/72lds2/every_beam_can_be_an_antibio_beam/), increasing the value of shields-4.

Distress beacons are less good than usual&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;probably still better than an unmarked beacon, but worse than a guaranteed fight.

### Balance Mod

Shields cost 120, and Titanium System Casing sells for 25.

Auto-assaults (which have drones) no longer appear in sector 1, so jumping to nebula beacons is safer. This also greatly reduces the chance of facing drones at suns: sun fights are 50% split between auto-ships and pirates, and the pirate ship is a random layout.


## Stealth B

Plan your jumps carefully, to avoid being forced into asteroid fields. Suns are also bad, since they have a higher chance of enemies with drones. Pulsars are awful: every 11&ndash;18 seconds, your Glaive has a 23.4% chance to be taken offline for 15 seconds.

Look for flexible routes, so you can skip these hazards without losing beacons. Try to avoid nebulas too, as they often contain Auto-assaults (with drones). Plasma storms are especially risky: you can only power the Glaive and a level-1 cloak, with no engines.

The ideal upgrade path is:

* Cloaking-3
* Hacking (hacking-2 by sector 3)
* Shields
* Shields-3, shields-4

Spend your first 50 scrap on cloaking-3. This lets you kill most enemies before they can fire, by cloaking first.

The Glaive falls off hard against 2 shields, so get extra offence before sector 3, and this is more important than shields. Hacking is ideal; failing that, look for a 1-power weapon.

2-power weapons are costly to get online with the Glaive: as well as buying the weapon, you need 165 scrap for weapons-6 and power. This can leave you vulnerable in sector 3 (and maybe even sector 4). Consider replacing the Glaive with another weapon that you can get online sooner; ideally still keep the Glaive for later, but sell it if necessary. For example, something like Flak 1 + Hull Laser 1 requires no upgrades and can last a long time.

Buying shields significantly increases your chance to find hacking later, so generally buy them when the store isn't selling hacking. Also consider buying backup battery. If the next store is selling systems, its chance to sell hacking is *approximately*:

* 33% if you bought no systems
* 40% if you have backup battery
* 50% if you have shields
* 60% if you have both

At intervals, consider buying a weapons buffer. Early on there are more important uses of scrap. However, if you pick up a two-power weapon, it may be worth buying the buffer while you wait.

Usually start the Glaive in shields, for maximum damage. Sometimes it's better to start in weapons or drones; for example, a manned Heavy Laser will fire before your Glaive finishes. But if this doesn't kill the ship or occupy all crew with repairs, they may run away before your Glaive can fire again. Use [exact beam placement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyJ37Eln-h8) to damage Zoltan ships through the Zoltan Shield. Hit a second system too when possible, as this pulls the pilot away and prevents them escaping.

Protect your weapons by checking where combat drones are aiming before you cloak. Only cloak if they are about to hit weapons or cloaking. While all drones hit the exact centre of the target room, beam drones do not "line up" at the exact angle they will fire, making them harder to predict.

Beam drones can drag across to an adjacent room. Beam 1 drones cannot drag across the "long side" of a room (their beam is shorter than 1 tile), but Beam 2 drones can.

Put the Zoltan on engines. On Hard, venting below 50% oxygen makes enemies less likely to target weapons or cloaking. Run the weapons crew to sensors to watch weapons charge. Depower your Glaive when the charge bar is full, but before weapons "turn green"; then repower when the charge bar resets. This [drastically reduces](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/7q5ko0/optimal_strategy_for_early_game_stealth_b_runs/) the chance of weapons being hit.

It takes 2.5 seconds to run to sensors. In cases where exact timing might matter, consider walking your engines Zoltan around the ship for timing the sensors dash (for example, against a beam drone). Standard crew movement speed is 0.45 seconds per tile. When second volleys matter, you can use your cloak cooldown as a timer (0.42 seconds per ion pip).

If your weapons *do* get hit, you are unlikely to win the fight. Running away is more important than repairing weapons, so prioritise repairs to piloting, engines, and cloaking. Stealth B can run surprisingly fast because cloaking buys time. Its effective minimum escape time is 28.3 seconds (realistically 30 or longer). Jump to a known safe beacon if possible, which often means jumping backwards.

Later on, with fully-trained weapons crew, you do not need to delay firing the Glaive against enemies with cloaking: it can hit them exactly as they enter cloak. Practise your weapons or hacking timing against non-cloaking enemies. Similarly, a pre-ignited Glaive can fire immediately against cloaking enemies (notably shieldless auto-scouts).

Distress beacons are less good than usual&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;probably still better than an unmarked beacon, but maybe worse than a guaranteed fight.

### Balance Mod

Consider visiting an early store: selling Titanium System Casing gets you 25 scrap closer to cloaking-3 (which costs 40). Shields cost 120.

Auto-assaults (which have drones) no longer appear in sector 1, so jumping to nebula beacons is safer (you might still want to avoid plasma storms). This also greatly reduces the chance of facing drones at suns: sun fights are 50% split between auto-ships and pirates, and the pirate ship is a random layout.

## Stealth C

Plan your jumps carefully, to avoid being forced into asteroid fields. Suns and pulsars are also bad, since they have a higher chance of enemies with drones. Look for flexible routes, so you can avoid these hazards without losing beacons. Consider avoiding nebulas too, as they often contain Auto-assaults (with drones)&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;but plasma storms are worth trying, as you have a clone bay for the [incapacitated ships event](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Plasma_Storm_Incapacitated_Ships).

Put the Slug in piloting. Put the Rock on weapons, because the central location offsets their slow movement; weapons is also an important room to repair, and Rocks have a hidden 67% bonus to fire-fighting. The Human can start in doors, and quickly move to engines.

Use your Shield Drone precisely. Activate it immediately in most fights, but sometimes delay it instead. For example, when you have shields and the enemy has a Basic Laser and a Hermes Missile: wait 6 seconds before powering the drone, and you can block a lot of missiles. You can also depower the drone after a shield is hit, to reset the drone's internal timer. For example, this makes you invulnerable against a Heavy Laser.

As with Stealth B, keeping oxygen below 50% decreases the chance of weapons being hit.

As with Stealth A, your starting weapons are strong but slot-inefficient. They *can* last the whole game, but you'll probably replace one of them eventually. The Mini Beam can hit four rooms on many ships.

Your strong weapons are your best defence, so spend your first 25 scrap on weapons-3 as a damage buffer. Typically buy shields next, and then look at improving offence or upgrading to shields-4. It's also reasonable to buy a weapon before shields, so consider doing this if you find something like a Flak 1. Also remember you can use the Mini Beam [as an Anti-bio Beam](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/72lds2/every_beam_can_be_an_antibio_beam/), increasing the value of shields-4.

Drones-3 is tempting, as it gives your Shield Drone a damage buffer. It also lets you run both drones together, which helps in fights against combat/beam drones. But it helps much less in other fights. Weapons-3 protects you in every fight and will definitely be used later&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;whereas you might sell one or both drones to afford shields! So on balance, I'd rather buy weapons-3 and then save for a store.

Don't underestimate the Shield+ Drone, however. Shields are more important, but I'll try to hold onto the drone if I reasonably can.

At pulsars, a single Zoltan Shield layer will completely absorb the ion pulse. Bizarrely, this only works *when you have a shields system*. Before then, pulsars will *ignore* the Zoltan Shield.



### Balance Mod

Shields now cost 120. Shield+ Drone sells for 25, and Anti-drone sells for 10. Shield+ only needs 1 power, so drones-3 doesn't do much.

Auto-assaults (which have drones) no longer appear in sector 1, so jumping to nebula beacons is safer. This also greatly reduces the chance of facing drones at suns: sun fights are 50% split between auto-ships and pirates, and the pirate ship is a random layout.


## Lanius A

Shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon. Rushing shields gives you more chances for safe crew kills. Early mind control strengthens your crew-killing abilities. Remember you only have engines-1.

Put one Lanius on piloting, to protect it from boarders and help with nearby venting. Put the other Lanius in engines: this makes it easier for them to help repair weapons without accidentally murdering their crewmate. It also lets you vent shields without moving crew, and the human is faster at running to doors or sensors.

Despite slow weapons, you can still get the first shot by hacking enemy weapons. Use this liberally in sector 1 to reduce risk. Don't wait with the Ion Stunner: fire when ready, and the shield will still be down for the lasers.

Ion Stunner can help with crew kills. For example: hack O2, destroy O2, then stun whoever repairs it. You can depower the Chain Laser after one shot to avoid damaging the hull (although this resets its charge time). Sometimes you can stun them in the shields room instead, as they walk towards O2.

Hacking often lets you farm crew skill early, by de-synchronising enemy weapons. For example, Heavy Laser + Basic Laser is completely harmless once hacked.

Double Lanius make a good boarding crew, so buying a teleporter is a solid fallback plan if weapons are thin (it also slots next to the clone bay).

Emergency Respirators have little use, but do help you vent more aggressively. Venting below 50% oxygen is easy on this ship, and increases the chance enemies will target O2 instead of something that matters. With two Lanius and a clone bay, you're pretty safe doing this.

[Defence drones work well on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/KaCw0ky.jpg), as all rooms are well outside the blind spot.

Hacking's cooldown is reset when you jump.

### Balance Mod

Emergency Respirators sell for just 12 scrap, so you might want to keep them a bit longer.


## Lanius B

Shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon. Remember you only start with engines-1. Despite its strength, this ship has nothing special defensively at the start, so it's still possible to have rough encounters.

Start both Lanius in the teleporter. Board shields, then mind control an enemy in the room. Make sure the enemy has space to stay in the room (move a Lanius out while paused, if necessary). Defending shields takes top priority, so enemies fight each other while your Lanius attack another system. This also pulls the pilot away, so your weapons have a better chance of hitting. When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 2 hull).

Your Lanius can't use the medical airlock, so try to limit damage to them. When enemy weapons are no longer a threat, you can take your time and avoid fighting crew directly. Destroy O2, then walk your Lanius around the ship to drain oxygen from rooms (especially weapons). Once a room has no air, you can get free combat XP by punching down the system. You can also trick enemies into running through airless rooms.

You can use your teleporter to abduct mind-controlled crew, but in most cases this is just too slow to be useful. Sometimes this could help save your Lanius's health.

If your Lanius get low on health, try to kill them off. You can blow them up on automated ships. On crewed ships, they can "dance" while nearly-dead enemy crew kill them. Later on, consider upgrading the clone bay to level 2.

Consider buying sensors eventually, for using mind control more flexibly. Sensors are not worth buying if you have a Slug or Lifeform Scanner.

Emergency Respirators have little use, but do help you vent more aggressively. Venting below 50% oxygen is easy on this ship, and increases the chance enemies will target O2 instead of something that matters. With two Lanius and a clone bay, you're pretty safe doing this.

[Defence drones work well on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/orY9chJ.jpg), as all rooms are well outside the blind spot. But you only have one system slot, so probably buy hacking or cloaking instead. Cloaking is particularly good, providing you have reasonable weapons&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and Advanced Flak gives you a huge head-start on that.

With cloaking, boarding, and mind control, it's easy to neutralise phase 1 and slowly kill off the crew. A single point of damage is enough to make the missiles harmless, and once damaged you can disrupt repairs with boarding and mind control. Consider upgrading mind control; level 3 is incredibly disruptive. Also consider upgrading sensors, in case they get hacked (making mind control harder to use).

Mind control's cooldown is reset when you jump (but teleporter's is not).

### Balance Mod

Emergency Respirators sell for just 12 scrap, so you might want to keep them a bit longer. Advanced Flak can distract defence drones, letting hacking sneak past.


## Crystal A

The starting weapons can handle two-shield enemies, so get shields-3, shields-4, then look for a weapon or teleporter.

Two Crystal crew make a strong boarding party. Each lockdown lasts 12 seconds; when enemies have two crew, you break 3 weapons bars in ~19 seconds. You can break weapons faster/more by adding mind control, hacking, upgrading teleporter, or just using your weapons.

Crystal weapons are powerful (early on) but slow, and don't play nicely with beams. Defence drones shoot them down! Depending on setup, both weapons can be kept until the end of the game; but Heavy Crystal is the better one.

Bear in mind that Engi and Rebel sectors have a higher chance of defence drones. Be particularly careful with the Virus event Engi blue option&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;if you can't kill the ship, you lose the Engi!

Sell Crystal Vengeance at the first store you visit.

Distress beacons are less good than usual&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;possibly still better than a "standard" beacon, but worse than a guaranteed fight (if you have map data).

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones work badly on this ship](https://i.imgur.com/CEsuzYp.jpg), as weapons are vulnerable.

### Balance Mod

The Crystal weapons can distract defence drones, allowing hacking to slip through. Crystal Vengeance sells for 20.


## Crystal B

You cannot touch Zoltan ships initially, and can cripple but not kill automated ships. In the worst possible case, you could be forced into a Zoltan sector 2 where you'll have to run from many fights. Cloaking also provides good defence, so consider delaying shield upgrades in the hope of finding a weapon.

If you are without weapons in a Rebel sector or Uncharted Nebula, consider buying clone bay so you can kill automated ships. Same goes for Abandoned sectors (although an upgraded teleporter will work there, with careful play).

Start fights with one Crystal in the teleporter, and have the pilot start walking there during the FTL jump. Put the other Crystal in sensors. Manning sensors delays two-Crystal boarding by about 1 second, but can be relevant for deciding whether to board with all three Crystals or keep one back for piloting and repairs. In particularly awful situations, sensor information can stop you sending crew on a suicide mission.

Each lockdown lasts 12 seconds. Hitting lockdown **immediately** when boarding can prevent enemy crew entering the room, even when they are standing on an adjacent tile. When unopposed, two Crystals will break 3 weapons levels in ~19 seconds; three Crystals will break 8 weapons levels (!) in ~33 seconds (in a four-tile weapons room).

Typically board weapons directly; but if they have crew manning the room, it may be better to board elsewhere and sneak back into weapons once it's empty (so you can break weapons without waiting to kill the enemy crew). Crew can walk straight through lockdown, provided they were already past the halfway point on the adjacent tile. Your Crystals can do this too: they will lockdown the room they're *currently* in, but still make it into the weapons room. When enemy crew are trying to break into a room, they will not stop to fight; use this to get free hits.

Consider pre-cloaking enemy weapons, if you think you can break them in time. Your cloak resets immediately after killing the enemy crew; use this to dodge last-second missiles.

Crystals can survive almost 39 seconds without air. Board auto-ships with two Crystals to neutralise them while getting combat training, but calculate enemy weapon timings to ensure you can repair the teleporter in time. Beware breaches, which double repair time to 25 seconds. It takes 6 seconds to walk from piloting.

Sell Crystal Vengeance at the first store (sells for 20 in Balance Mod). You only have one system slot left, so get hacking.

&hellip;and I lied again. It's [technically possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/al3bil/safely_destroying_auto_ships_with_a_medbay_on_the/) to kill automated ships, with perfect timing. Make one tiny slip and you lose a Crystal though, so I don't think the risk is worth the reward. It's not like this ship needs the scrap.
