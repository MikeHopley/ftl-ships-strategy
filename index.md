# About this guide

I wrote this guide first for myself, second for others. It contains all kinds of tips, from basic strategy to extremely advanced micro.

Some of these tips are tiny optimisations that usually don’t matter. Depending on your skill level and also how you prefer to play, you may want to ignore those parts.

Less experienced players might find it overwhelming in places. I recommend skipping over the parts you don’t understand, for now. You can always come back to them later.


# Play the early game well

To win consistently on Hard, you must play as “safely” as possible and get through the dangerous early game in good shape. To be “safe”, you need two things ASAP:

* Two shields
* Offence that works well against two-shield enemies

“Offence” at this stage usually means a weapon, but it could be hacking, mind control, teleporter, or a combat drone. Prefer 1- or 2-power weapons that you can get online quickly.

Hacking is especially strong. When I say “look for a weapon”, that’s really  shorthand for “look for a weapon, or hacking, or other offence”. But ideally I like to start with a good weapon, then add hacking a bit later.


# General early strategy

For most ships and most runs:

* Spend your first 20 scrap on shields-3
* Spend your next 30 scrap on shields-4
* Then save for a weapon, or other offence

Shields-3 provides a damage buffer, so your shield will not go down from (say) a Leto. Bad luck if it’s an Artemis instead, but at least your shield comes back sooner. Most of the time, you can get away without this; but it only takes one nasty fight where you lose 20 hull to make you appreciate the value of shields-3.

Don’t wait on power before buying shields-4. Having two shields makes you vastly safer in sectors 1 and 2: many enemies will be unable to hurt you at all. Power can come much later; save for a weapon first.

This strategy has a downside: it may stop you buying something useful in a sector 1 store, such as a weapon. Sector 2 could have an awful layout that prevents you from finding any stores, or all the stores might sell only crew and augments.

For that reason, it’s sometimes worth delaying your shield upgrades briefly. There are two possibilities:

* Get shields-3 immediately, but delay shields-4
* Delay both

You can also choose how long you delay them. You could delay just a few jumps, because you are circling around a store in the middle of the sector. Or you could wait for a store at the end of sector 1 or early sector 2.

In most circumstances (but not all), I think it’s incorrect to delay shield upgrades more than a few jumps.


## What factors influence this decision?

The biggest factor is what ship you are playing. Some ships have safer starts. Some ships are more desperate for additional offence. Some ships have more stuff to sell at a store. These concerns often compete with each other.

When a ship starts with strong defence or offence, delaying shield upgrades is less risky. For example, Zoltan C is a lot safer because it starts with a Zoltan Shield and fast offence. Kestrel A and Rock A are a little safer, because they start with two-point weapons buffers for the Artemis. Federation C is not at all safe.

When a ship urgently needs extra offence, delaying shield upgrades is more worthwhile. Rock A needs to solve its missile problem fast.

When a ship has more stuff to sell, visiting early stores is more worthwhile and does not delay your shields as much. Rock A need only float 18 scrap to afford even a teleporter, but Kestrel A would need to float 80 for hacking or a full choice of weapons.

Beware greed. If you’re only in the market for top-tier weapons, it’s probably incorrect to delay shield upgrades. A good question to ask yourself might be, “if an early store had a Chain Laser, would I buy it?”


## Other strategies

Engines-2 and engines-3 are useful and cheap. Fit them in when you can; but do not allow engine upgrades to delay shield upgrades, or stop you buying an important weapon. At 15 scrap, engines-3 competes with shields-3, and I think shields-3 is almost strictly better.

Note that shields-4 is **much** better than early engine upgrades, because it also lets you farm crew skill against enemies that cannot hurt you. 10% free evade is about 90 scrap value!

Piloting-2 can be tempting when you’re visiting nebula beacons without a clone bay, for a [chance of a free weapon](http://ftl.wikia.com/wiki/Plasma_Storm_Incapacitated_Ships). But this is very luck-dependent. That 20 scrap is better spent on shields-3.

Never waste early-game scrap on luxury purchases like medbay-2, doors-2, or Scrap Recovery Arm.


## Exceptions

The Stealth cruisers have no shield system at all, and Zoltan B only has shields-1. Mantis B starts with shields-4.

The strategies for these ships are quite different, reflecting their special starting conditions.


# The ships

## Kestrel A

The starting weapons can handle two-shield enemies, and you have nothing to sell, so typically rush shields and then look for a weapon. However, you also have a 2-point weapons buffer for the Artemis, which gives a degree of safety. Occasionally it may be better to save scrap for an early store, especially if early jumps drop vendor trash.

Conserve missiles, but do use the Artemis against threatening weapons. Keep the Artemis unless you need the slot or absolutely need the scrap. If you find no weapons but do get crew, consider buying a teleporter: the Artemis provides good boarding support.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual.

You have no blue options for distress beacons in sector 1, so prefer unmarked beacons.


## Kestrel B

The starting weapons can handle two-shield enemies, and you have little to sell, so typically rush shields and then look for a weapon. Your Zoltan can [power shields-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=1m59s) against ion.

Your strong offence also provides a degree of safety, however. Occasionally it may be better to save scrap for an early store, especially if early jumps drop vendor trash.

Ideally you want fast weapons to complement your remaining Basic Lasers. If you find only slow weapons, consider hacking or mind control instead, as this keeps your volley fast for longer. You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little early anyway.

Move the shield-room Mantis to doors initially. Put the Zoltan on engines; remember you can use them to [de-ionise shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=52s). Cooldown systems like hacking and mind control appear rather far away from the main systems, so power-stealing is awkward.

You have no blue options for distress beacons in sector 1, so prefer unmarked beacons.


## Kestrel C

Treat it as a weaker Lanius A (no hacking) or Kestrel A (weaker weapons).

You have little to sell, and a single hit to weapons makes your offence very weak. Almost always rush shields and then look for a weapon. Rushing shields also means more chances for early crew kills.

Dual Lasers are fantastic on a 4-slot ship. The Ion Stunner can help you get crew kills: destroy O2, then stun the crew repairing it.

Typcially you’ll wait a moment for the Ion Stunner to (nearly) reach shields, then fire the Dual Lasers at weapons. But against some enemy weapons, it’s better to fire immediately. If all shots hit, the Dual Lasers will take down one weapon, and the ion will disable the second (even a two-power weapon).

Put the Lanius on piloting, to protect it from boarders and help with nearby venting. Pre-vent nearby rooms, then allow them to refill slightly: refilling makes it easier for other crew to distract your Lanius if they get mind-controlled.

With a Lanius and clone bay, venting below 50% oxygen is reasonably safe. Consider doing this in the early game, to increase the chance that enemies target O2 instead of something that matters.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. You have a clone bay and a good blue option from the Ion Stunner.


## Engi A

Typically rush shields and then look for a weapon. Rushing shields gives more chances for early crew kills.

However, you do have a 30-scrap augment to sell, and generally you’re quite safe in early fights. Two Engis make fast repairs. So sometimes it might be better to delay shield upgrades slightly, and visit an early store.

Early on, micromanage the drone to break a shield for your ion, which can then rapidly take down weapons. Against harmless ships, try ionising O2 for a crew kill.

Late-game the Ion Blast 2 needs help from another ion weapon to reliably take down shields. This leaves only one slot for a hull-damaging weapon. Some combinations work, but don’t be afraid to ditch the ion in exchange for reliable damage-dealers.

Med-bot Dispersal is usually best sold. Take note of the [unknown disease event](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Unknown_Disease_on_Mining_Colony), however. With med-bots and medbay-2, this gives a high scrap reward and a weapon. This event occurs in Civilian, Pirate, Mantis, Rock, and Uncharted Nebula sectors (at a distress beacon).

Start your engines crew on doors. Just remember to send them back!

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting, since Engi give good blue options.


## Engi B

You urgently need extra offence, since you **cannot** harm ships with two shields. Bad offence makes you vulnerable, however, so shield upgrades are urgent too. You want crew as well, but they are a much lower priority than shields and weapons.

The ship does have a lot to sell at a store, especially if you get free crew early. AP Drone sells for 17, Repair Drones for 15 each, and DRB for 25. Heavy Ion sells for 22. This gives a total of **94 scrap** in sellable items.

Until you get more crew, it’s typically best to keep one Repair Drone and the AP Drone. Selling both Repair Drones is viable, but selling the AP drone is really dangerous. Keeping the AP drone brings down the sellable total to 77 scrap.

Because you are so vulnerable, typically rush shield upgrades. It’s even worth hitting an immediate store to trade drone stuff for shields. Rushing shields also gives more chances for early crew kills. Use the Heavy Laser as a shield-breaker, so you can ion O2.

If your weapons take one damage, you can still attack. Fire the ion then switch to the laser (you can wait to see if the ion hits).

Use your Engi for manning and repairs; you only have 10% dodge anyway. Walk them towards weapons during the FTL jump.

Vent below 50% oxygen to reduce the chance of enemies targeting weapons. Your Repair Drones make this quite safe. Before the fight, drop O2 to 95%. Open all doors, shut the weapons left door, and shut the doors right door. With O2 off, this gets you below 50% in under 8 seconds.

The drone system requires power to be smart-targeted. Turn on a drone before enemy weapons fire. It may be worth deploying an AP drone before it’s even needed, as that powers the system without letting Repair Drones unpark themselves (see below).

Note that enemy boarders will stay in an airless room, provided they are already fighting your “crew”. Try to time your venting so that the AP Drone arrives shortly before the air leaves.

Heal your AP drone between fights, even though it’s tedious. [Park Repair Drones](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/8mxqw5/depower_a_repair_drone_to_park_it_in_a_system/) for quicker repairs and to prevent boarders trashing them; but they sometimes insist on returning home before repairs, so maybe park them close to the drone room! Note that having even one extra crew helps you [control Repair Drones](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/7wvjed/controlling_system_repair_drones/).

When a vented room is on fire, Repair Drones will wait for the fires to go out before setting off. Sometimes you might want to turn the drones off until the room is vented, to make them prioritise another room.

Sector 1 distress beacons are well worth visiting. You have good blue options from the Engi and both drones. It might even be better to pick distress over a guaranteed fight, especially since early fights can go badly on this ship.

At the [Engi Research Station event](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Engi_Research_Station), it’s always safe to save the Engi.

&hellip;and I lied. It is [technically possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/6eoqw6/impossible_to_get_through_2_bubbles_with_the/) to kill two-shield enemies with your starting weapons, if you’re utterly desperate.


## Engi C

Typically rush shields, then look for a weapon. Hacking provides some safety, however, and you have a lot to sell. Sometimes it may be better to save for an early store.

Dual Lasers are great, but may eventually need to be replaced with more slot-efficient weapons. Defence Scrambler does almost nothing and can be sold immediately (defeat anti-drones by de-powering your beam drone).

At each fight, consider whether to use your beam drone, hacking, both&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;or neither! Remember that preventing a damage cascade is more important than hoarding resources, and this is especially relevant while you only have 1 shield. It’s mostly best to use two drones early on, just look for opportunities where you can safely economise.

Choose your hacking targets carefully in the early game. Hacking weapons is tempting, as it lets you fire first; but this only gives you one (targeted) damage against enemy weapons and only if both shots hit. Hacking shields is often better, as it gives you two shots against enemy weapons and a way to do damage even if your weapons are taken out. On the other hand, hacking weapons is great when you can de-synchronise them.

Line up your drone early, as this gives a better chance to hit important systems. If it’s aiming at something useless, let it reposition while you wait for weapons / hacking.

Try crew kills when safe: hack O2 then immediately destroy it. Hacking often lets you farm crew skill early, by de-synchronising enemy weapons.

With a Lanius and clone bay, venting below 50% oxygen is reasonably safe. Consider doing this in the early game, to increase the chance that enemies target O2 instead of something that matters.

Start your engines crew on sensors, as enemy crew composition may be relevant when choosing a hack target. Just remember to send them back!

Hacking’s cooldown resets when you jump.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. You have a clone bay, plus blue options from the Engi (good) and drone (weak).


## Federation A

This ship starts vulnerable, due to weak offence that goes offline with a single hit. Rush shields, then look for a weapon. Teleporter is a reasonable fallback plan, since you start with decent boarders.

Buying a weapons buffer for 25 scrap is a reasonable alternative to rushing shields, but I still think the shield upgrades are safer overall. Do get the weapons buffer when you can, but not if it might prevent you buying a weapon.

Artillery is nice late-game if you have scrap to spare (particularly for the Flagship), but too expensive to upgrade earlier. Beware enemies running away: when possible, manage the artillery power so that it’s ready to fire immediately after your weapons hit, or vice-versa.

Since artillery uses a system slot, you can only pick two more systems. [Defence drones cover this ship poorly](https://i.imgur.com/Y92J2ml.jpg): weapons and drones are vulnerable.

For crew positions, I like: Rock piloting, Mantis engines, Human weapons, Engi starting on doors. The Engi should be mobile for repairs, and can move to shields if doors aren’t needed. Piloting is awkward to vent, so the Rock’s fire-immunity and 67% fire-fighting bonus is helpful. Weapons is a high-priority room to repair, so I prefer the Human over the Mantis here.

Consider pre-venting the empty rooms on the right side, then letting them refill a bit. Also consider pre-venting the top-left rooms above engines.

Sector 1 distress beacons are well worth visiting. You have good blue options with Engi and Rock crew, and a weak one from the Artillery. A guaranteed fight is probably still better.


## Federation B

This ship starts vulnerable due to weak offence. Rush shields, then look for a weapon. A weapons buffer is also good, but I think the shield upgrades are safer. Get the weapons buffer when you can, but not if it might prevent you buying a weapon.

Your Zoltan can [power shields-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=1m59s) against ion. Leto is weak but worth keeping unless you need the slot for something else. Dual Lasers are fantastic on a 4-slot ship; almost always keep them.

[Defence drones cover this ship poorly](https://i.imgur.com/TpuD5BE.jpg): shields and weapons are vulnerable. Avoid spending scrap on the artillery beam, unless everything else is set.

Put the Slug in piloting, and the Zoltan in weapons: they can [de-ionise shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=52s) and steal power from mind control or hacking, which are slotted nearby (although cloaking slots next to engines). Consider starting the engines crew on doors; just remember to send them back!

The layout is a little awkward, but you can still vent shields or weapons in under 3 seconds by using **all** airlocks and turning off O2.

Enemies may start running away when your weapons or artillery hits them, so try to have the other damage source ready to fire immediately afterwards. Manage the power on your Artillery so that it fires at a good time.

In sector 1, prefer unmarked beacons over distress. Your have weak blue options from the Slug and artillery.


## Federation C

This ship takes a lot of early damage, since it has no quick way to disable enemy weapons. Rush shields, then look for weapons. Weapons-2 costs 40 scrap, so 1-power weapons are particularly helpful early on. A Small Bomb is ideal.

When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 1 hull).

Mantis and Human are the strongest and safest boarding party (Zoltan bombing is more cute than effective). Keeping Zoltans at home also has tactical advantages: they can ion-proof your clone bay, [ion-proof one shield layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=3m15s), or [de-ionise shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=52s) even when you have multiple layers.

Running the engines Zoltan through the teleporter powers it and counters teleporter hacks. You can move them during the FTL jump; with correct placement, they man engines ~3 seconds after the battle starts.

Emergency Respirators make automated ships much easier to board. Keep them until you need to sell them for something better, like a weapon.

As usual, the artillery is too expensive to upgrade, unless you are late in the game with plenty of scrap. Unlike a normal flak weapon, it does not disrupt cloaking.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. You have a clone bay, plus an okay teleporter blue option.


## Zoltan A

The Zoltan Shield provides strong defence in most fights, the Halberd never misses, and the Leto is a backup if your weapons get damaged. Therefore this ship has a very safe start. It’s also important to find hacking or shield-breaking weapons before sector 3. Delay shield upgrades enough to visit any store with 80 scrap.

Shields-4 is the next priority. You start with only engines-1. Engines-2 and engines-3 are cheap and work well with the Zoltan Shield, but shields-4 is still better. Fit in engine upgrades later, when you can.

Try to keep the Leto until you run out of weapon slots. It’s tempting to upgrade weapons early and use both together, but this delays shields-4 and could prevent you buying hacking.

In early fights, typically use the Halberd and start the beam in shields for maximum damage. Be aware that some enemies (such as Rebels) are quite likely to have shields-3. Occasionally it may be better to open fights with a Leto to weapons, before switching to the Halberd; consider which weapon will be switched off.

Your first extra crew member is worth one free power, replacing the pilot. Don’t forget that two Zoltans can completely [ion-proof one shield layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=3m15s), and can also [de-ionise shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=52s) even when you have multiple layers.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual.

In sector 1, prefer unmarked beacons over distress. Your only blue option is from the Halberd (weak).


## Zoltan B

Shields-2 costs a whopping 100 scrap. Before then, your Zoltan Shield will serve well in most encounters, but you are vulnerable against asteroid fields and drones. Therefore your first 100 scrap should typically be spent on shields. It’s also reasonable to buy a weapon first, but only if it’s a great weapon (like a Flak 1 or Heavy Laser) or a useful cheap weapon (like another Ion Blast).

Do not buy engine upgrades before shields, even though they’re so much cheaper: you don’t even need evasion for most fights, and it won’t help you much in the really dangerous fights. Getting that shield up even one jump earlier could be crucial.

Once you have a regular shield, your Zoltan Shield and fantastic weapons make sectors 1 and 2 very safe. Consider delaying shields-3 and maybe shields-4, in the hope of finding a good weapon.

Before shields-2, consider avoiding nebula beacons, as they often have Auto-assaults (with drones). If you meet [the mercenary](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mercenary) early in sector 1, it might be worth paying for map data to avoid asteroid fields.

Use your weapons optimally against enemies with one shield. You can fire both ions immediately at weapons (or drones), and the Pike Beam will still do full damage before the shield comes up. On the second volley, you can sneak at least one ion inside the shield: micromanage them so both fire from the third weapon slot initially (giving a longer travel time), then bring them forwards for the second volley (be careful though: with a Zoltan in the room, weapons depower as you move them!).

When enemies have one shield and cannot harm you, try ionising O2 for a crew kill. You can also use the Pike Beam [as an Anti-bio Beam](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/72lds2/every_beam_can_be_an_antibio_beam/), but the timing is quite difficult.

This ship is somewhat vulnerable to boarding. Start the engines Zoltan on doors (due to event boarding). Additional crew help, and the first gives one free power by replacing the pilot. If doors get boarded, you can vent them out and then reoccupy it. Consider pre-venting the three empty rooms to the right of doors (and then letting oxygen refill a bit).

Don’t forget that two Zoltans can completely [ion-proof one shield layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=3m15s), and can also [de-ionise shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=52s) when you have multiple layers. Here’s a surprising fact about pulsars: even while you only have shields-1, a single Zoltan in the shields room will guarantee that the pulse hits the shield system (but probably it’s better to just send all three Zoltans into the weapons).

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones cover this ship poorly](https://i.imgur.com/hUidgrH.jpg): weapons and drones are vulnerable.

Sector 1 distress beacons are somewhat worth visiting, mostly because they are not asteroid fields! You have one blue option from the Ion Blast (good, but just one event).


## Zoltan C

Zoltan Shield provides strong defence in most fights, and you kill early enemies quickly. Therefore delay shield upgrades and save scrap for a weapon. Power constraints also make shields-4 less immediately useful (although still very good).

Autofiring the ion on shields is not always the best tactic. Consider sending some ion into enemy weapons; this kills ships more slowly but can be safer. Micro the drone so it doesn’t waste time firing when their shield is up. Against enemies with two shields, fully charge the Charge Ion for the first volley to help it "stick" (and if you only hit one shot, start again).

Delay using the backup battery as long as possible&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;usually after your Zoltan Shield goes down. Position the beam drone so it will fire the instant shields go down, then divert its power to engines. You do not need the battery for this! When the beam drone has started firing, cutting power will not interrupt its beam; you can micro that power to engines as a shot comes in.

With that in mind, consider your crew positions carefully, and move them around as needed. You can start two Zoltans in weapons, with the other two in engines and piloting. This is simple and flexible. When fights drag on and your battery is about to run out, consider moving the pilot into drones.

For better defence in boarding events, you can start one of the weapons Zoltans in the bottom-left corner of drones (where they can dash into doors).

The clone bay is vulnerable to event boarding; pre-vent it, then let oxygen refill to 90%. This lets you vent the clone bay in 4 seconds using 4 airlocks. If you forget to do this, you can use all 6 airlocks (venting through weapons too). In both cases, turn off O2.

Charge Ion is the best ion weapon in the game. Adding another 2-power ion weapon will take down shields reliably for the whole game (even a 1-power ion will do, especially mid-game). Hacking somewhat overlaps with the ion cascade, but is still very strong. For example, hack shields and ionise weapons.

Early reactor upgrades are expensive. In the early game, avoid buying more than you absolutely need. You can get by with much less than you might think, for quite some time. Your first extra crew member gives one free power (replacing the pilot).

Don’t forget that two Zoltans can completely [ion-proof one shield layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=3m15s), and can also [de-ionise shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=52s) when you have multiple layers.

Backup battery’s cooldown resets when you jump.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. You have a clone bay, plus blue options from Charge Ion (good) and the drone (weak).


## Mantis A

Rush shields, then look for offence. Weapons-2 is 40 scrap; buying this lets you use the Small Bomb and Basic Laser together, and also gives you a damage buffer for the Small Bomb. This is a good early upgrade, but don’t let it prevent you buying a weapon or hacking.

Mantis Pheromones is somewhat useful, but also fine to sell. Small Bomb is a great boarding support weapon, and can also disable enemy weapons. Use it liberally in sector 1 to reduce risk.

Mind control can be a strong purchase on a two-tile boarding ship, especially early, as it enables the same early-game tactics as Lanius B.

When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 1 hull). Boarding with three crew can often disable clone/medbays without spending missiles.

Start two Mantis in the teleporter. I like the third Mantis on piloting, as that’s closer to the teleporter and makes the Engi more mobile. Start your fourth crew on weapons, then run to engines as needed.

Consider upgrading teleporter somewhat early, as this lets you board automated ships. Also consider avoiding nebula beacons early on, especially if you are low on missiles.

Weapons and shields are awkward to vent. Consider pre-venting them, then letting oxygen refill a bit.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visting. You have blue options from the Engi (good) and teleporter (okay).


## Mantis B

Despite its apparent strength, this ship is vulnerable at the start because Mantis crew are terrible at repairs and fire-fighting. Plan routes that let you revisit a previous beacon and repair after a disaster.

Mantis B’s nemesis is an Automated ship with a Small Bomb and Burst Laser 2. Even with **perfect** play, you’ll die about 1 time in 3. I’m not kidding.

The quickest fix is engines. Engines-2 increases your odds of survival to ~94%, engines-3 to nearly 100% and likely to take a lot less damage. If you see an immediate store, take it. You can sell Mantis Pheromones and buy engines-2, maybe engines-3.

After you’ve taken care of early-game safety, look for weapons, crew, or hacking. One-power weapons are particularly good, because you can use them immediately. A Small Bomb lets you disable enemy weapons (or medbays). An Ion Blast is cheap and lets you attack Zoltan ships.

Once you have three crew, you gain the option of using distraction tactics to break weapons (see Mantis C for an explanation).

The boarding drone will eventually kill any automated ship, unless it lands in an isolated piloting room. That means it can kill 90% of automated ships, unless they are running away. With an upgraded teleporter, this becomes 100% with the help of your Mantis, but it’s not worth 30 early-game scrap. Regardless, consider avoiding nebula beacons early on.

When the drone starts leaving a room, you can sometimes make it change destination by toggling power. For example, when the drone lands in the shields room on an auto-scout, you can force its next room to be weapons instead of piloting.

Don’t hesitate to spend drone parts when fights look dangerous. Your boarding drone is not just for automated ships. A rapid crew-kill can be your best defence.

Precise venting helps against solar flares or fire-lighting weapons. Just before the fire starts, have no oxygen in the bottom-left corner, and switch off O2; but also close the doors. [Repairing O2 is possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47ENy6-CAM&t=1m22s) even in a fully-vented ship, providing you have medbay-2: you’ll need to run relays, and the timing is very tight.

Leave one Mantis in piloting (to start the FTL charging immediately), and put the other in sensors. This delays boarding by under 2 seconds, but occasionally stops you sending crew on a suicide mission. When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 1 hull).

The defence drone is [unreliable at protecting shields and drones](https://i.imgur.com/qSlV6gW.jpg). You only have one spare system slot, so get cloaking or hacking. Probably hacking, which allows you to kill the Flagship crew easily.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. Even without blue options, distress beacons can give crew, and are safer on average. The Boarding Drone has a low-scrap blue option.

You also have good blue options from the teleporter and Defence Drone, but they apply to [the same event](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_Asteroid_Belt_Distress_Beacon). The drone is typically better, but risks system damage with a fire; and the teleporter gives a 50% chance of crew. Therefore choose teleporter unless maybe you already got some non-Mantis crew.


## Mantis C

Rush shields, then look for weapons. Finding weapons is not urgent though, as the Stun Bomb lets you beat any enemy in the game&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;[including the Flagship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4di0ohYcOs&t=9m55s)! If you’re still low on crew in the mid-game, buy some.

Hit early stores to fund your shield upgrades. Selling Lockdown Bomb and Mantis Pheromones gives you 47 scrap.

Although keeping both bombs does extend your tactical options, they mostly overlap in function. Either bomb is sufficient for boarding support. The Stun Bomb is more tactically useful, and also lets you break Zoltan shields.

Start the Mantis in the teleporter. Walk the Engi pilot to sensors during the FTL jump (force them to go the bottom route), and the Lanius from weapons to the teleporter (so the teleporter stays oxygenated). This gives you sensor information, and lets you board as fast as possible with either two or three crew.

Sometimes the safest option is the simplest: just kill the enemy crew as quickly as possible.

Boarding with all three crew often lets you disable clone/medbays without spending missiles. It can also be your most effective way to disable enemy weapons, using distraction tactics similar to Lanius B. Board shields, wait for all enemies to enter, then move two crew to weapons. All the enemy crew will stay in shields, giving you time to break at least one weapon. To extend your time punching weapons, swap healthy crew into shields (keeping one in shields at all times).

This tactic fails when enemies have three crew **and** a two-tile shields room. In some fights it’s also risky to leave your ship unattended. It may be safer to leave your Engi at home for repairs.

For even more time punching weapons, use your bombs tactically. Lockdown lasts for 12 seconds, and stun lasts for 15. You can stun all the enemy crew in shields; then if needed, use the Lockdown Bomb as well. Or lockdown weapons first, then stun the crew trying to break in. Or you might want to use the Stun Bomb on weapons, to switch off a dangerous weapon more quickly. There are many possible tactics!

With good timing, it’s possible to dodge all your crew out a room while stunning the enemy crew. Even just stunning your Lanius is effective: enemy crew will rapidly suffocate. Stunning them in an airless room can be more effective than attacking the medbay.

The Lanius cannot use the medical airlock, so try to limit damage to them or get them killed off just before the fight ends. When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 1 hull).

Note that stuns can be chained when manning weapons with level 1 training, and so can lockdowns with fully-trained crew (but only just, so occasionally enemy crew will get through). 

[Defence drones cover this ship poorly](https://i.imgur.com/QALokZf.jpg): shields and weapons are vulnerable.

With a Lanius and clone bay, venting below 50% oxygen is reasonably safe. Consider doing this in the early game, to increase the chance that enemies target O2 instead of something that matters.

Sector 1 distress beacons are well worth visiting&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;maybe even better than a guaranteed fight, considering how useful extra crew are to this ship. You have a clone bay, plus blue options from the Engi (good) and teleporter (good for this ship).


## Slug A

Rush shields, then look for a weapon. Rushing shields gives more opportunities for safe crew kills.

Start fights with Dual Lasers and Breach Bomb powered, then switch to Anti-bio Beam when enemies are not a threat. Use the bomb against threatening weapons. The Breach Bomb can be an effective crew-killing weapon too; it does 30 crew damage. Breaches attract a second crew once repaired, giving a chance to double the damage from a laser or bomb. Sometimes you can use the Breach Bomb for early skill-farming against automated ships (permanently disabling a weapon).

Dual Lasers are fantastic on a 4-slot ship; almost always keep them. Anti-bio Beam is good for crew-kills early on, but falls off later; don’t be afraid to sell it in exchange for something more straightforward. Breach Bomb remains useful the whole game, but you may find something more potent instead.

Start your second Slug on weapons, then move to engines as needed. Venting the front of the ship is awkward, so consider pre-venting and letting oxygen refill a bit.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones cover this ship well](https://i.imgur.com/IQpdpCr.jpg), as all rooms are outside the blind spot.

Sector 1 distress beacons are probably worth visiting. You have blue options from the Anti-bio Beam (good) and the Slug (weak).


## Slug B

Rush shields, then look for a weapon. You don’t need clone/medbay as urgently as you might think (prefer clone bay).

Even without Reconstructive Teleport, you *can* skip clone/medbay entirely, for an extra system slot. I don’t recommend it though, because because clone/medbay will always take up a slot in stores, making it harder to find the systems you want. The extra system is only an endgame advantage, and by that time you’ve already won.

Mind control can be a strong purchase on a two-tile boarding ship, especially early, as it enables the same early-game tactics as Lanius B.

Consider teleporter-2, so you can more safely board automated ships. Without it, you can still board if you destroy piloting with your Artemis first (guaranteeing the Healing Burst will hit).

Start fights with one Slug in the teleporter, one in weapons, and the pilot walking towards the teleporter during the FTL jump. This gives the most flexibility: you have the option of boarding immediately, and also charging your Artemis as fast as possible.

Precise boarding technique helps your bombs/missiles hit. Use the [Safety Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0j4rFfmFDc) to pull the pilot away. When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 1 hull).

You can fight in the weapons room and hit it with a missile, dodging your crew out just in time. But it’s difficult to time consistently, so never do this when your crew are low on health (the Artemis does 30 crew damage).

[Defence drones cover this ship poorly](https://i.imgur.com/vOgB7mg.jpg): as weapons and clone/medbay are vulnerable.

Sector 1 distress beacons are…maybe worth visiting. You have blue options from the teleporter (okay) and the Slug (weak).


## Slug C

Rush shields, then look for a weapon. A weapons buffer is also good, but I think the shield upgrades are safer overall. Get the weapons buffer when you can, but not if it might prevent you buying a weapon.

Rushing shields gives you more opportunities for safe crew kills. Mind control can often get the job done by itself (with lasers to finish them off). Otherwise hack oxygen. You can de-power the Chain Laser to fire a single shot, and it will keep its chain progress if you are quick enough.

Chain Laser is slow, but you can still get the first shot by hacking enemy weapons. Hack liberally to reduce damage and risk, especially while you only have 1 shield.

Early-game tactics are slightly different depending on enemy crew count. Against two crew, mind control the pilot when you fire the Chain Laser. But against three crew, usually mind control the weapons crew instead: this guarantees one point of system damage at 12.5 seconds.

Later, when enemies have more crew, someone will go fight the mind-controlled crew in weapons. But if you hacked weapons, they have to break down the doors first, so often you still get to damage weapons. If a human has to walk 1.6 or more tiles *net distance* to the doors, they won’t break them in time. “Net distance” means you subtract the distance that the mind-controlled crew move; that 1.6 minimum distance is actually 3 tiles minus 1 diagonal.

When completely safe and with a guaranteed crew-kill, damage the hull for surrender offers (as low as 1 hull). The safest way to do this is mind-controlling the pilot (on ships with level 1 piloting). Hacking often lets you farm crew skill early, by de-synchronising enemy weapons.

[Defence drones cover this ship well](https://i.imgur.com/bhrfCeE.jpg), as all rooms are outside the blind spot.

Hacking and mind control reset their cooldowns when you jump.

Sector 1 distress beacons are probably worth visiting. You have a clone bay and a blue option from the Slug (weak).


## Rock A

You urgently need non-missile offence. Ideally get good weapons, but you really need *two* weapons to make a reasonable loadout for sector 3, and that can be tricky without some luck. Nevertheless, a single non-missile weapon at least reduces your missile usage, so consider damage-dealers like a Heavy Laser. Even an Ion Blast is good, as it’s cheap and helps against Zoltan Shields.

Seriously consider buying a teleporter. This fixes your missile dependency and gives you a reliable way to win fights for a long time, as the Artemis is a great boarding support weapon.

The Artemis has a 2-point weapons buffer, so delay shield upgrades enough to afford a weapon or teleporter. Selling the Rock Plating and Hull Missile nets you 72 scrap, so you only need to float 18 scrap.

Bear in mind the Hull Missile may still be useful if you bought a teleporter: you might get forced into an Abandoned sector 2. Similarly, consider keeping the Rock Plating if you can: it has a blue option that guarantees a weapon in one reasonably common event in Engi, Rock, and Pirate sectors. Without the blue option, it’s 1/3 chance.

Use missiles as efficiently as possible, but do use them against threatening weapons. Sometimes it might not be worth fighting a Zoltan ship. As a last resort, buy missiles: it’s better than being unable to win fights. Accept missile-heavy surrenders.

When enemy hull is a multiple of 4, consider just using Hull missiles; otherwise, consider destroying piloting with the Artemis to guarantee a Hull Missile will hit. Bear in mind that enemy ships can run away: for example, against a 10-hull enemy, consider starting with a Hull Missile before the Artemis to piloting. If they start running away when the Artemis hits, they have no chance of escape.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones cover this ship well](https://i.imgur.com/Hrmzp9N.jpg), as all rooms are outside the blind spot.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. You have blue options from Rock crew (good) and Rock Plating (okay). 


## Rock B

Your offence is good initially, but terrible against two-shield enemies. You also have a weapons buffer for the Heavy Pierce. Delay shield upgrades enough to afford a weapon. Selling Rock Plating and Fire Bomb gets you 65 scrap, so you only need to float 15 scrap.

Heavy Pierce is good early on, but power-hungry and does not play well with beam weapons. The Fire Bomb can get some early crew kills, but only use it when you are safe. Avoid selling the Fire Bomb unless it gets you something important, as it can help you kill the Flagship crew.

By itself, the Fire Bomb is not that effective, except against Mantis. Enemies prioritise fighting fires, and can usually put them out efficiently. The explosion does 30 crew damage, but that’s a lot of missiles to kill crew directly. Soften them up with the Heavy Pierce first; either target crew directly, or maybe try for a breach in O2. Breaches attract a second crew once repaired, giving a chance to double your Fire Bomb damage.

It’s tempting to upgrade weapons early, so you can use them together; but this doesn’t improve your offence enough. That scrap is better saved for buying a weapon, a system, or shields-4. Mind control or hacking makes the Fire Bomb much better. Also consider a teleporter for Rock fire-boarding shenanigans.

Doors are much too expensive to buy. Note you don’t get airlocks, although hull breaches can be used. You *can* fire-bomb your own ship to help with boarding defence, but this is rarely useful. Mind control helps, especially against the Flagship. Phase 3 boarders can be rough without doors/venting, so you have extra incentive to kill the crew in phase 1; you can do this by fire-bombing shields, together with mind control or hacking.

Rock crew are good at putting out fires (67% bonus), but it’s important to stay on top of them. Fires can rage out of control in 4-tile rooms, so try to put them out quickly. In bad situations, turning off O2 can help fires burn themselves out faster.

You have level 2 oxygen, but without doors it can’t counteract a breach. The Flagship’s Boarding Drone may be annoying, so consider oxygen-3 if you already have everything else you need.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones cover this ship well](https://i.imgur.com/FUSYVNi.jpg), as all rooms are outside the blind spot.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. You have blue options from Rock crew (good) and Rock Plating (okay).


## Rock C

You have a 2-point buffer for the Heavy Crystal. Consider delaying shield upgrades, in the hope of finding a good weapon.

Weapons are good early on, but a little awkward to upgrade. In particular, Heavy Crystal doesn’t play well with beams. Although inaccurate against small rooms, Swarm Missiles can fire before almost any enemy weapon. Use them to reduce damage and risk, especially early on.

Remember to use your Crystal tactically when defending against boarders! You have good boarding crew, so a teleporter is a good fallback plan if weapons are lacking.

Sector 1 distress beacons are well worth visiting. You have a clone bay, plus blue options from Rock crew (good) and Rock Plating (okay).


## Stealth A

Plan your jumps carefully, to avoid being forced into asteroid fields. Suns and pulsars are also bad, since they have a higher chance of enemies with drones. Look for flexible routes, so you can skip these hazards without losing beacons. Consider avoiding nebulas too, as they often contain Auto-assaults.

Time your volley precisely. It’s often best to wait a moment before firing the Dual Lasers, so that the Mini Beam damages engines to increase the chance of the second laser hitting. When possible, start firing the Dual Lasers before cloaking. The Mini Beam can hit four rooms on many ships.

Against Zoltan Shields, use [precise beam placement and timing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPji41olyFM&t=1m20s) to help disable weapons.

With hacking, the starting weapons can both be kept for the whole game. More likely, you’ll replace at least one with something harder-hitting. Nevertheless, don’t ignore the possibility of keeping both; you can save a lot of scrap on weapons upgrades.

As on Stealth B, keeping oxygen below 50% decreases the chance of weapons/cloaking being hit. With fast weapons though (and a long walk to sensors), it’s not worth using the weapons depower trick.

90% evade during cloak gives you good defences, but you can still get unlucky&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;especially against drones. Spending your first 25 scrap on a weapons buffer significantly improves survivability: those weapons are your strongest defence early on. After weapons-3, save up for shields and weapons. If you see a great weapon, buy it before shields. Also consider buying temporary weapons, such as an Ion Blast.

Cloaking-2 fills a similar role to weapons-3, as it often lets you fire an extra volley. I think weapons-3 is better, because (a) your weapons can still get hit through cloaking and (b) it will be useful when you get more weapons. Taking *both* weapons-3 and cloaking-2 makes you very safe in sectors 1 and 2, but I think that 30 scrap is better saved for offence and shields.

Once you have shields, upgrading them is not urgent (since you have cloak too). You can skip shields-3, which effectively does the same job as your weapons buffer. However, shields-4 is still a priority, and getting it early gives you more chance of training evade against the easier enemies in sector 2. Also remember you can use the Mini Beam [as an Anti-bio Beam](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/72lds2/every_beam_can_be_an_antibio_beam/), increasing the value of shields-4.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting, but guaranteed fights are better. You only have blue options from cloaking-1 (weak) and Mini Beam (weak). However, note that Long-Ranged Scanners effectively decrease the value of unmarked beacons.


## Stealth B

Put the Zoltan on engines. They can steal power from cloaking.

Plan your jumps carefully, to avoid being forced into asteroid fields. Suns and pulsars are also very bad. Try to avoid nebulas too, as they disable your sensors and often contain Auto-ships.

Look for flexible routes, so you can skip these hazards without losing beacons. Try to plan a route that lets you retreat to a previous beacon. This gives you a safe place to recover after a disaster. Also plan around doubled fleet pursuit.

Usually start the Glaive in shields, for maximum damage. Sometimes it’s better to start in weapons or drones; for example, a manned Heavy Laser may fire before your Glaive finishes. Against Zoltan Shields, use [exact beam placement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ8uLSidl7o) to damage weapons.

The ideal upgrade path is:

* Cloaking-3
* Hacking
* Shields

Spend your first 50 scrap on cloaking-3. This lets you kill most enemies before they can fire, by cloaking first. The Glaive falls off hard against 2 shields, so try to get extra offence before sector 3. Hacking is by far the best option.

If hacking is not offered, generally buy shields. Buying shields significantly increases your chance to find hacking later. Also consider buying backup battery. If the next store is selling systems, its chance to sell hacking is *approximately*:

* 33% if you bought no systems
* 40% if you have backup battery
* 50% if you have shields
* 60% if you have both

The most difficult choice is between shields and a weapon. Usually take shields. Even a Burst Laser 2 is somewhat risky without shields, because unlike hacking it can miss. Shields make you a lot safer, especially once upgraded&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;but that’s another 50 scrap into defence that won’t help you kill 3-shield enemies in sector 4.

2-power weapons are very expensive to get online (165 scrap for weapons-6 and power), so generally prefer 1-power weapons. An Ion Blast 1 is especially good, because it’s cheap. Spending less scrap on weapons gives you a better chance to switch into hacking later.

Also consider replacing the Glaive with another weapon that you can get online sooner; ideally still keep the Glaive for later, but sell it if necessary. For example, something like Flak 1 + Hull Laser 1 requires no upgrades and can last a long time.

At intervals, consider buying a weapons buffer. Early on there are more important uses of scrap. However, if you pick up a two-power weapon, it may be worth buying the buffer while you wait.

Protect your weapons by checking where combat drones are aiming before you cloak. Only cloak if they are about to hit weapons, cloaking, or possibly sensors. Otherwise, delay your cloak until enemy weapons fire. Even then, wait to see whether weapons are targeting anything important. Ideally you’ll let them hit irrelevant rooms, to reduce the chance of the drone sniping your Glaive when cloak ends.

All drones hit the exact centre of the target room, but beam drones do not “line up” at the exact angle they will fire, making them harder to predict. Beam drones can drag into an adjacent room. Beam 1 drones cannot drag across the “long side” of a room (their beam is shorter than 1 tile), but Beam 2 drones can. It’s worth knowing the odds of a bad drag:

* Beam drone 1:
  * From sensors, 13% drag into cloaking
  * From the empty room above weapons, 7% drag into weapons
* Beam drone 2: 
  * From doors, 53% drag into weapons
  * From weapons, 33% drag into cloaking
  * From cloaking, 27% drag into weapons
  * From the empty room above weapons, 27% drag into weapons
  * From sensors, 27% drag into cloaking

It’s also worth knowing how fast they attack, to help decide when to cloak. On average:

* Combat 1 attacks every 2.9 seconds
* Combat 2 attacks every 1.9 seconds
* Beam 1 attacks every 3.6 seconds
* Beam 2 attacks every 4.4 seconds

Mini Beam into cloaking has a 40% chance to drag into weapons. Cloaking is less likely to be targeted when on cooldown, so you should pre-cloak the Mini Beam (unless perhaps that stops you cloaking another weapon). This also gives the best chance of running away.

If your weapons *do* get hit, don’t just rush all your crew to repair them. Keep the FTL charging, and also try to repair cloaking. The correct repair priorities are very difficult to judge, and depend on the situation. If you jump away with critical systems damaged, jump to a known safe beacon.

Later on, with fully-trained weapons crew, you do not need to delay firing the Glaive against enemies with cloaking: it can hit them exactly as they enter cloak. Practise your weapons or hacking timing against non-cloaking enemies. Similarly, a pre-ignited Glaive can fire immediately against cloaking enemies (notably shieldless auto-scouts).

Watch out for *Pirate* Mantis Interceptors, because you can’t hit both shields and weapons. Consider this when a fight is optional.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting, but guaranteed fights are better. You have blue options from cloaking (okay, good once upgraded) and the Glaive Beam (weak). Note that Long-Ranged Scanners effectively decrease the value of unmarked beacons.

### Hard-mode trickery

On Hard specifically, enemy targeting can be manipulated to reduce the chance that your weapons or cloaking get hit.

Run the weapons crew to sensors to watch weapons charge. Depower your Glaive when the charge bar is full, then repower when the charge bar resets. This [drastically reduces](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/7q5ko0/optimal_strategy_for_early_game_stealth_b_runs/) the chance of weapons being targeted, from 31.5% to 6.5%.

Note that you can’t use the sensors trick in a nebula! This is another reason to avoid them. Also consider that a drone hit into sensors effectively makes enemy weapons more dangerous.

Venting below 50% oxygen makes enemies less likely to target cloaking. It also reduces the chance of weapons being targeted to 14.8%, but that’s only relevant if you can’t toggle the weapons power. Venting also has some risks, for example if your O2 gets hacked.

For that reason, vent precisely. Before jumping, drop O2 to 75%. Then vent the 4 empty rooms in the top part of the ship, with O2 off. This gets you under 50% O2 in ~6 seconds, or ~3 seconds if you also vent the airlock below engines. You can then decide whether to vent at the start of a battle.

Wait to see where enemy hacks land before venting. Get your weapons crew near a door. Remove power from rooms before they get hacked, especially weapons (on the first hack).

### *Now you’re just being silly*

Consider walking your engines Zoltan around the ship for timing the sensors dash. You can use my [Zoltan treadmill](https://mikehopley.github.io/zoltan-treadmill/) for accurate timing.

It’s even possible to time enemy weapons purely with crew movement and weapon animation (and this can potentially be used by *any* ship). This means you can continue using the trick when sensors don’t work, such as in a nebula. It means you can let beam drones hit your sensors without cloaking.

In most cases this will charge your Glaive slightly faster too. This can sometimes matter more than you might expect. For example, an unmanned Small Bomb will explode just *after* your Glaive finishes firing.

Use crew movement to time the weapon charge and de-power, wait for the weapon to “go green”, then re-power on the *next* animation frame. For missiles and bombs, listen for the firing sound.

When you don’t know the type of missile, de-power and wait a few frames to see if it turns green. Bombs are easy: they start animating before charge resets. Flak doesn’t have a “green” frame; just re-power on the first animation.

Occasionally, it might be better to station the Zoltan in sensors, for the absolute minimum loss of charge time. For example, consider an Ion Blast and Burst Laser 2. With **minimal** interruption, a manned Glaive will usually *start* firing before an *unmanned* Burst 2 shot lands. This gives you the option of cloaking the ion if it’s heading into weapons. The same approach could also work against unmanned Heavy Laser + Burst 2, when the enemy weapons room is directly next to their shields.


## Stealth C

Plan your jumps carefully, to avoid being forced into asteroid fields. Suns and pulsars are also bad, since they have a higher chance of enemies with drones. Look for flexible routes, so you can avoid these hazards without losing beacons. Consider avoiding nebulas too, as they often contain Auto-assaults&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;but plasma storms are worth trying, for the [incapacitated ships event](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Plasma_Storm_Incapacitated_Ships).

Put the Slug in piloting. Put the Rock on weapons, because the central location offsets their slow movement; weapons is also an important room to repair, and Rocks have a hidden 67% bonus to fire-fighting. The Human can start in doors, and quickly move to engines.

[Use your Shield Drone precisely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KrfF8NN3yQ). Against Zoltan Shields, use [precise beam placement and timing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPji41olyFM&t=5m39s) to help disable weapons.

As with Stealth B, keeping oxygen below 50% decreases the chance of weapons being hit.

As with Stealth A, your starting weapons are strong but slot-inefficient. They *can* last the whole game, but you’ll probably replace one of them eventually. The Mini Beam can hit four rooms on many ships.

Your strong weapons are your best defence, so spend your first 25 scrap on weapons-3 as a damage buffer. Typically buy shields next, and then look at improving offence or upgrading to shields-4. It’s also reasonable to buy a weapon before shields, so consider doing this if you find something like a Flak 1. Also remember you can use the Mini Beam [as an Anti-bio Beam](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/72lds2/every_beam_can_be_an_antibio_beam/), increasing the value of shields-4.

Drones-3 is tempting, as it gives your Shield Drone a damage buffer. It also lets you run both drones together, which helps in fights against combat/beam drones. But it helps much less in other fights. Weapons-3 protects you in every fight and will definitely be used later&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;whereas you might sell one or both drones to afford shields! So on balance, I’d rather buy weapons-3 and then save for a store.

At pulsars, a single Zoltan Shield layer will completely absorb the ion pulse. Bizarrely, [this only works when you have a shields system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcfjeR9GIhQ&t=3m45s). Before then, pulsars will *ignore* the Zoltan Shield.

Sector 1 distress beacons are well worth visiting, but guaranteed fights are better. You have a clone bay, plus blue options from the Rock (good), Slug (weak), and beam (weak). Note that Long-Ranged Scanners effectively decrease the value of unmarked beacons.


## Lanius A

Typically rush shields, then look for a weapon. Hacking gives a good amount of safety, however, and you have Emergency Respirators to sell. Sometimes it might be better to delay shield upgrades for an early store.

Rushing shields reduces your reliance on hacking for safety, and gives more chances for safe crew kills. Early mind control can strengthen your crew-killing abilities. Remember you only have engines-1.

You can put a Lanius on piloting, to protect it from boarders. However, I currently prefer putting the human on piloting, since that makes it easier for the Lanius to help each other with nearby repairs.

Despite slow weapons, you can still get the first shot by hacking enemy weapons. Use this liberally in sector 1 to reduce risk. You can fire the Ion Stunner immediately, and the shield will still be down for the lasers. But sometimes it’s be better to fire them together: if all shots hit, the ion will disable a second weapon (even a two-power weapon).

Ion Stunner can help with crew kills. For example: destroy O2, then stun whoever repairs it. You can depower the Chain Laser after one shot to avoid damaging the hull; if done quickly, this won’t reset the chain. Sometimes you can stun them in the shields room instead, as they walk towards O2. Hacking O2 makes crew kills more reliable.

Hacking often lets you farm crew skill early, by de-synchronising enemy weapons. For example, Heavy Laser + Basic Laser is completely harmless once hacked.

If weapons are thin, buy a teleporter. Double Lanius make excellent boarders, especially with hacking. Hack and board weapons, luring out any weapons crew first. Your Lanius can break weapons with little interruption: with doors locked and oxygen drained, enemy crew will barely hinder them. Adding mind control makes this even stronger: now their weapons crew works for you, or you can use Lanius B distraction tactics followed up with the Ion Stunner. Nevertheless, prefer cloaking to mind control.

Emergency Respirators have little use, but do help you vent more aggressively. Venting below 50% oxygen is easy on this ship, and increases the chance enemies will target O2 instead of something that matters. With two Lanius and a clone bay, you’re pretty safe doing this.

[Defence drones cover this ship well](https://i.imgur.com/KaCw0ky.jpg), as all rooms are well outside the blind spot.

Hacking’s cooldown is reset when you jump.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. You have a clone bay and a good blue option from the Ion Stunner.



## Lanius B

Rush shields, then look for a weapon. Remember you only start with engines-1. Despite its strength, this ship has nothing special defensively at the start, so it’s still possible to have rough encounters.

Move the Engi to weapons during the FTL jump. Start both Lanius in the teleporter, and [use distraction tactics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmEKvFe8A30) to make enemies fight in shields while your Lanius punch down another system (such as weapons or medbay). When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 1 hull).

Distraction tactics will occupy up to 4 crew in a big shields room. When ships have more crew, they will follow your Lanius around.

Your Lanius can’t use the medical airlock, so try to limit damage to them. When enemy weapons are no longer a threat, you can take your time and avoid fighting crew directly. Instead of actually fighting in an airless room, dance your Lanius in the doorway to keep enemies repositioning. Then trick low-health enemies into walking through the airless room, by attacking a system on the opposite side.

You can use your teleporter to abduct mind-controlled crew, but in most cases this is just too slow to be useful. Sometimes this could help save your Lanius’s health.

If your Lanius get low on health, try to kill them off. You can blow them up on automated ships. On crewed ships, they can "dance" while nearly-dead enemy crew kill them. Later on, consider upgrading the clone bay to level 2.

Consider buying sensors eventually, for using mind control more flexibly. Sensors are not worth buying if you have a Slug or Lifeform Scanner.

Emergency Respirators have little use, but do help you vent more aggressively. Venting below 50% oxygen is easy on this ship, and increases the chance enemies will target O2 instead of something that matters. With two Lanius and a clone bay, you’re pretty safe doing this.

[Defence drones cover this ship well](https://i.imgur.com/orY9chJ.jpg), as all rooms are well outside the blind spot. But you only have one system slot, so probably buy hacking or cloaking instead. Cloaking is particularly good, providing you have reasonable weapons&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and Advanced Flak gives you a huge head-start on that.

With cloaking, boarding, and mind control, it’s easy to neutralise phase 1 and slowly kill off the crew. A single point of damage is enough to make the missiles harmless, and once damaged you can disrupt repairs with boarding and mind control. Consider upgrading mind control; level 3 is incredibly disruptive. Also consider upgrading sensors, in case they get hacked (making mind control harder to use).

Mind control’s cooldown is reset when you jump (but teleporter’s is not).

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. You have a clone bay, plus blue options from the Engi (good) and teleporter (okay).


## Crystal A

Typically rush shields, then look for a weapon. You have a lot to sell, however, and a 2-point weapons buffer for the Heavy Crystal gives some safety. Consider delaying shield upgrades if you see an early store.

If weapons are thin, seriously consider a teleporter. Two Crystal crew make a strong boarding party. Each lockdown lasts 12 seconds; when enemies have two crew, you break 3 weapons bars in ~19 seconds. You can break weapons faster/more by adding mind control, hacking, upgrading teleporter, or just using your weapons.

Crystal weapons are powerful (early on) but slow, and don’t play nicely with beams. Defence drones shoot them down! Depending on setup, both weapons can be kept until the end of the game; but Heavy Crystal is the better one.

Bear in mind that Engi and Rebel sectors have a higher chance of defence drones. Be particularly careful with the Virus event Engi blue option&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;if you can’t kill the ship, you lose the Engi!

Sell Crystal Vengeance at the first store you visit.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones cover this ship poorly](https://i.imgur.com/CEsuzYp.jpg), as weapons are vulnerable.

Crew positions are hard to decide. I like Crystals in piloting and weapons, with humans in engines and doors. Piloting and weapons are good rooms for lockdown, and spreading humans around the ship means more flexibility for repairs and fighting fires. This isn’t ideal for boarding, but if you cross-train it doesn’t matter.

You have no blue options for distress beacons in sector 1, so prefer unmarked beacons.


## Crystal B

Pre-vent the cloaking room, as it’s a long way from your other stations. You might even pre-vent weapons.

Consider delaying shield upgrades slightly. You cannot touch Zoltan ships initially, and can cripple but not kill automated ships. In the worst possible case, you could be forced into a Zoltan sector 2. Crystal Lockdown makes you very safe in most fights, and cloaking adds more safety. You also have 40 scrap from Crystal Vengeance.

If you are without weapons in a Rebel sector or Uncharted Nebula, consider buying clone bay so you can kill automated ships. Same goes for Abandoned sectors (although an upgraded teleporter will work there, with careful play).

Start fights with one Crystal in the teleporter, and have the pilot start walking there during the FTL jump. Put the other Crystal in sensors. Manning sensors delays two-Crystal boarding by about 1 second, but can be relevant for deciding whether to board with all three Crystals or keep one back for piloting and repairs. In particularly awful situations, sensor information can stop you sending crew on a suicide mission.

Each lockdown lasts 12 seconds. Hitting lockdown **immediately** when boarding can prevent enemy crew entering the room, sometimes even when they are standing on an adjacent tile. When unopposed, two Crystals will break 3 weapons levels in ~19 seconds; three Crystals will break 8 weapons levels (!) in ~33 seconds (in a four-tile weapons room).

Typically board weapons directly; but if they have crew manning the room, it may be better to board elsewhere and [sneak back into weapons](https://streamable.com/dnyto) once it’s empty. Crew can walk straight through lockdown, provided they were already past the halfway point on the adjacent tile.

Consider pre-cloaking enemy weapons, if you think you can break them in time. Your cloak resets immediately after killing the enemy crew; use this to dodge last-second missiles.

Crystals can survive 39 seconds without air. Board auto-ships with two Crystals to neutralise them while getting combat training, but calculate enemy weapon timings to ensure you can repair the teleporter in time. Beware breaches, which double repair time to 25 seconds. It takes 6 seconds to walk from piloting.

Sell Crystal Vengeance at the first store. You only have one system slot left, so get hacking.

Sector 1 distress beacons are…maybe worth visiting. You have blue options from cloaking-1 (weak) and teleporter (okay).

…and I lied again. It’s [technically possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/al3bil/safely_destroying_auto_ships_with_a_medbay_on_the/) to kill automated ships, with perfect timing. Make one tiny slip and you lose a Crystal though, so I don’t think the risk is worth the reward. It’s not like this ship needs the scrap.
