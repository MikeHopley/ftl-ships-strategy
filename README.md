## TODO:

* Check AI behaviour for Lanius B shield-boarding tactic. How many crew before you are opposed? How many stop you pulling the pilot?
* (Maybe?) Add combat / beam drone DPS to Stealth B, to help estimate overall expected damage and deciding whether running is even possible.
* (Maybe?) Rephrase defence drone efficacy, to make it sound less bad to buy.
