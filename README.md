# FTL ships guide
Strategy and early-game tactics for all ships

## TODO:

* Test whether drones require power to be smart-targeted (relevant to Engi B)
* Check AI behaviour for Lanius B shield-boarding tactic. How many crew before you are opposed? How many stop you pulling the pilot?
* (?) Reconsider Engi B strategy: 94 scrap in sellables, so better to just rush shields? How bad is it really to sell all the drones (with only one crew)?
* (?) Add combat / beam drone DPS to Stealth B, to help estimate overall expected damage and deciding whether running is even possible.
* (?) Rephrase defence drone efficacy, to make it sound less bad to buy.
