## To do:

* Fed C: check whether flak artillery disrupts cloaking
* Lanius B: check AI behaviour for shield-boarding tactic. How many crew before you are opposed? How many stop you pulling the pilot?
* Engi B
  - 94 scrap in sellables, so better to just rush shields? How bad is it really to sell the AP drone?
  - Check Heavy Ion + Reloader: can it self-stack with untrained crew, if you reposition the weapon and hit the shield ROOM on the first shot?
  - Test whether drones require power to be smart-targeted (so turn them on to draw fire)
